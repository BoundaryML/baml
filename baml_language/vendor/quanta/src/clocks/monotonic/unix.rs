        // We really don't ever expect to actually _get_ negative values from `clock_gettime`, but
        // given the types, it's technically possible.  This is due to the fact that `tv_sec` is
        // supposed to be `time_t`, which Unix/POSIX-compliant systems implement as a signed number.
        // Accordingly, `tv_nsec` follows suit using a signed number.
        //
        // Given the adjustments made by NTP to clocks like CLOCK_MONOTONIC, and that
        // CLOCK_MONOTONIC can be anchored to an arbitrary point, and a whole skew of other
        // scenarios where it could be modified... it's technicaly possible to get back valid
        // negative values.  If we did math between `timespec` objects, the delta should be valid,
        // even with negative numbers.
        //
        // We're returning a u64 here, though, so it is what it is.  In practice, I've _never_ seen
        // negative values under normal operation.  If someone discovers a valid scenario where this
        // is violated and that we need to account for, I'll be colored impressed, but also, file an
        // issue and we'll do what we have to do to rework the code to try and support it better.
        //
        // Until then, though, we're just gonna ignore the lint.
