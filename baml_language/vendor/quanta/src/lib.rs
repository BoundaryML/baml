//! Performant cross-platform timing with goodies.
//!
//! `quanta` provides a simple and fast API for measuring the current time and the duration between events. It does this
//! by providing a thin layer on top of native OS timing functions, or, if available, using high-speed timing features
//! (TSC, System Counter) found on modern CPUs.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Internally, `quanta` maintains the concept of two potential clock sources: a reference clock and a source clock.
//!
//! The reference clock is provided by the OS, and always available. It is equivalent to what is provided by the
//! standard library in terms of the underlying system calls being made. As it uses the native timing facilities
//! provided by the operating system, we ultimately depend on the OS itself to give us a stable and correct value.
//!
//! The source clock is a potential clock source based on the [Time Stamp Counter][tsc] or [System Counter][syscnt]
//! feature found on modern x86-64 and AArch64 CPUs, respectively If these features are not present or are not reliable
//! enough, `quanta` will transparently utilize the reference clock instead.
//!
//! Depending on the underlying processor(s) in the system, `quanta` will figure out the most accurate/efficient way to
//! calibrate the source clock to the reference clock in order to provide measurements scaled to wall clock time.
//!
//! Details on TSC/System Counter support, and calibration, are detailed below.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Beyond simply taking measurements of the current time, `quanta` provides features for more easily working with
//! clocks, as well as being able to enhance performance further:
//!
//! - `Clock` can be mocked for testing
//! - globally accessible "recent" time with amortized overhead
//!
//! ## Mocked time
//!
//! For any code that uses a `Clock`, a mocked version can be substituted. This allows for application authors to
//! control the time in tests, which allows simulating not only the normal passage of time but provides the ability to
//! warp time forwards and backwards in order to test corner cases in logic, etc. Creating a mocked clock can be
//! acheived with [`Clock::mock`], and [`Mock`] contains more details on mock usage.
//!
//! ## Coarsely-updated, or recent, time
//!
//! `quanta` also provides a "recent" time feature, which allows a slightly-delayed version of time to be provided to
//! callers, trading accuracy for speed of access. An upkeep thread is spawned, which is responsible for taking
//! measurements and updating the global recent time. Callers then can access the cached value by calling
//! `Clock::recent`. This interface can be 4-10x faster than directly calling `Clock::now`, even when TSC support is
//! available. As the upkeep thread is the only code updating the recent time, the accuracy of the value given to
//! callers is limited by how often the upkeep thread updates the time, thus the trade off between accuracy and speed of
//! access.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! `quanta` comes with feature flags that enable convenient conversions to time types in other popular crates, such as:
//!
//! - `prost` - provides an implementation into [`Timestamp`][prost_types_timestamp] from `prost_types`
//!
//! # Platform Support
//!
//! At a high level, `quanta` carries support for most major operating systems out of the box:
//!
//! - Windows ([`QueryPerformanceCounter`][QueryPerformanceCounter])
//! - macOS/OS X/iOS ([`mach_absolute_time`][mach_absolute_time])
//! - Linux/*BSD/Solaris ([`clock_gettime`][clock_gettime])
//!
//! These platforms are supported in the "reference" clock sense, and support for using TSC/System Counter as a
//! clock source is more subtle, and explained below.
//!
//! ## WASM support
//!
//! This library can be built for WASM targets, but in this case the resolution and accuracy of measurements can be
//! limited by the WASM environment. In particular, when running on the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target in browsers,
//! `quanta` will use [window.performance.now] as a clock. This mean the accuracy is limited to milliseconds instead of
//! the usual nanoseconds on other targets. When running within a WASI environment (target `wasm32-wasip1`), the
//! accuracy of the clock depends on the VM implementation. On `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`, `quanta` uses Emscripten's
//! POSIX-compatible monotonic clock.
//!
//! # High-speed timing support
//!
//! We support two primary mechanisms for a high-speed source clock: TSC on x86-64 platforms with SSE2, and System Counter
//! on AArch64 platforms.
//!
//! ## Time Stamp Counter (x86-64)
//!
//! For TSC, the processor must support either constant or nonstop/invariant TSC. This ensures that the TSC ticks at a
//! constant rate which can be easily scaled. A caveat is that "constant" TSC doesn't account for all possible power
//! states (levels of power down or sleep that a CPU can enter to save power under light load, etc) and so a constant
//! TSC can lead to drift in measurements over time, after they've been scaled to reference time.
//!
//! This is a limitation of the TSC mode, as well as the nature of `quanta` not being able to know, as the OS would,
//! when a power state transition has happened, and thus compensate with a recalibration. Nonstop/invariant TSC does not
//! have this limitation and is stable over long periods of time.
//!
//! Roughly speaking, the following list contains the beginning model/generation of processors where you should be able
//! to expect having invariant TSC support:
//!
//! - Intel Nehalem and newer for server-grade
//! - Intel Skylake and newer for desktop-grade
//! - VIA Centaur Nano and newer (circumstantial evidence here)
//! - AMD Phenom and newer
//!
//! Ultimately, `quanta` will query CPUID information to determine if the processor has the required features to use the
//! TSC.
//!
//! ## System Counter (AArch64)
//!
//! On ARMv8 and newer, the System Counter represents an "always-on device, which provides a fixed frequency
//! incrementing system count. The system count value is broadcast to all the cores in the system, giving the cores a
//! common view of the passage of time."
//!
//! This counter is readable through a user-mode system register that is always architecturally present, so compiling
//! against `aarch64` is enough to utilize it.
//!
//! One note is that prior to ARMv8.6-A, the counter frequency could vary between processors, and is anecdotally in the
//! range of 1MHz to 50MHz, which means that the _resolution_ of measurements might be as high as 1,000 nanoseconds.
//! After ARMv8.6-A, and in ARMv9, the counter frequency is fixed at 1GHz, providing 1 nanosecond resolution.
//!
//! # Calibration
//!
//! As the TSC/System Counter don't necessarily tick at reference scale -- i.e. one tick isn't always one nanosecond --
//! we have to apply a scaling factor when converting from source to reference time scale to provide this. We acquire
//! this scaling factor by repeatedly taking measurements from both the reference and source clocks, until we have a
//! statistically-relevant measure of the average scaling factor. We do some additional work to convert this scaling
//! factor into a power-of-two number that allows us to optimize the code, and thus reduce the generated instructions
//! required to scale a TSC/System Counter value.
//!
//! This calibration is stored globally and reused. However, the first `Clock` that is created in an application will
//! block for a small period of time as it runs this calibration loop. The time spent in the calibration loop is limited
//! to 200ms overall. In practice, `quanta` will reach a stable calibration quickly (usually 10-20ms, if not less) and
//! so this deadline is unlikely to be reached.
//!
//! # Caveats
//!
//! Utilizing the TSC/System Counter can be a tricky affair, and so here is a list of caveats that may or may not apply,
//! and is in no way exhaustive:
//!
//! - CPU hotplug behavior is undefined
//! - raw values may time warp
//! - measurements from the TSC/System Counter may drift past or behind the comparable reference clock
//!
//! Another important caveat is that `quanta` does not track time across system suspends. Simply put, if a time
//! measurement (such as using [`Instant::now`][crate::Instant::now]) is taken, and then the system is suspended, and
//! then another measurement is taken, the difference between those the two would not include the time the system was in
//! suspend.
