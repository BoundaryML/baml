To set a value to an environment variable, use the following syntax:

```baml
env.YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME
```

<Warning>Environment variables with spaces in their names are not supported.</Warning>

### Example

Using an environment variable for API key:

```baml
client<llm> MyCustomClient {
    provider "openai"
    options {
        model "gpt-4o-mini"
        // Set the API key using an environment variable
        api_key env.MY_SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY
    }
}
```

    You can put other components inside Accordions.

    ```ts
    export function generateRandomNumber() {
      return Math.random();
    }   
    ```

  <Accordion title="For your app (default)">
    BAML will expect these to be set already in your program **before** you import the baml_client in Python/ TS / etc.

    Any of the following strategies for setting env vars are compatible with BAML:
    - setting them in your shell before running your program
    - in your `Dockerfile`
    - in your `next.config.js`
    - in your Kubernetes manifest
    - from secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
    - from a secrets provider such as [Infisical](https://infisical.com/) / [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/)
    - from a `.env` file (using `dotenv` cli)
    - using account credentials for ephemeral token generation (e.g. Vertex AI Auth Tokens)

    ```bash
    export MY_SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY="..."
    python my_program.py
    ```
