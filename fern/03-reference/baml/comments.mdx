## Single line / trailing comments

Denoted by `//`.

```baml
// hello there!
foo // this is a trailing comment
```

## Docstrings

We have no special syntax for docstrings. Instead, we use comments.
Eventually, we'll support a `///` syntax for docstrings which will
also be used for generating documentation in `baml_client`.

{/* ## Docstrings

To add a docstring to any block, use `///`.

```baml
/// This is a docstring for a class
class Foo {
    /// This is a docstring for a property
    property1 string
}
``` */}

{/* ## Multiline comments

Multiline comments are denoted via `{//` and `//}`.

```baml
{//
    this is a multiline comment
    foo
    bar
//}
``` */}
 
## Comments in block strings

See [Block Strings](./values/string#block-strings) for more information.

```baml
#"
    My string. {#
        This is a comment
    #}
    hi!
"#
```
