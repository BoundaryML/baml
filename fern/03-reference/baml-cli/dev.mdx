The `dev` command starts a development server that watches your BAML source files for changes and automatically reloads the BAML runtime. This feature is designed to streamline the development process by providing real-time updates as you modify your BAML configurations.

## Usage

```
baml-cli dev [OPTIONS] --preview
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--from <PATH>` | Path to the `baml_src` directory | `./baml_src` |
| `--port <PORT>` | Port to expose BAML on | `2024` |
| `--preview` | Enable the preview feature |  |

## Description

The `dev` command performs the following actions:

1. Starts a BAML development server on the specified port.
2. Watches the specified `baml_src` directory for file changes.
3. Automatically reloads the server when changes are detected.
4. Docs are served on [http://localhost:2024/docs](http://localhost:2024/docs).

## Examples

1. Start the development server with default settings:
   ```
   baml-cli dev --preview
   ```

2. Start the development server with a custom source directory and port:
   ```
   baml-cli dev --from /path/to/my/baml_src --port 3000 --preview
   ```

## Testing

To test the development server, you can use the following `curl` command to check if the server is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:2024/_debug/ping
```


Call a function:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2024/call/MyFunctionName -d '{"arg1": "value1", "arg2": "value2"}'
```
