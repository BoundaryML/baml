The `generate` command is used to generate BAML clients based on your BAML source files. It processes the BAML configurations and creates the necessary client code for your specified output type.

## Usage

```
baml-cli generate [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--from <PATH>` | Path to the `baml_src` directory | `./baml_src` |
| `--no-version-check` | Generate `baml_client` without checking for version mismatch | `false` |

## Description

The `generate` command performs the following actions:

1. Finds all generators in the BAML project (usualy in `generators.baml`).
2. Ensure all generators match the CLI version.
3. Generate each `baml_client` based on the generator configurations.

## Examples

1. Generate clients using default settings:
   ```
   baml-cli generate
   ```

2. Generate clients from a specific directory:
   ```
   baml-cli generate --from /path/to/my/baml_src
   ```

3. Generate clients without version check:
   ```
   baml-cli generate --no-version-check
   ```

## Output

The command provides informative output about the generation process:

- If no clients were generated, it will suggest a configuration to add to your BAML files.
- If clients were generated, it will report the number of clients generated and their locations.


## Notes

- If no generator configurations are found in the BAML files, the command will generate a default client based on the CLI defaults and provide instructions on how to add a generator configuration to your BAML files.
- If generator configurations are found, the command will generate clients according to those configurations.
- If one of the generators fails, the command will stop at that point and report the error.
