The `init` command is used to initialize a project with BAML. It sets up the necessary directory structure and configuration files to get you started with BAML.

## Usage

```
baml-cli init [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--dest <PATH>` | Specifies where to initialize the BAML project | Current directory (`.`) |
| `--client-type <TYPE>` | Type of BAML client to generate | Guesses based on where the CLI was installed from (`python/pydantic` for pip, `typescript` for npm, etc.) |
| `--openapi-client-type <TYPE>` | The OpenAPI client generator to run, if `--client-type=openapi` | None |

## Description

The `init` command performs the following actions:

1. Creates a new BAML project structure in `${DEST}/baml_src`.
2. Creates a `generators.baml` file in the `baml_src` directory with initial configuration.
3. Includes some additional examples files in `baml_src` to get you started.

## Client Types

The `--client-type` option allows you to specify the type of BAML client to generate. Available options include:

- `python/pydantic`: For Python clients using Pydantic
- `typescript`: For TypeScript clients
- `ruby/sorbet`: For Ruby clients using Sorbet
- `rest/openapi`: For REST clients using OpenAPI

If not specified, it uses the default from the runtime CLI configuration.

## OpenAPI Client Types

When using `--client-type=rest/openai`, you can specify the OpenAPI client generator using the `--openapi-client-type` option. Some examples include:

- `go`
- `java`
- `php`
- `ruby`
- `rust`
- `csharp`

For a full list of supported OpenAPI client types, refer to the [OpenAPI Generator documentation](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#overview).

## Examples

1. Initialize a BAML project in the current directory with default settings:
   ```
   baml init
   ```

2. Initialize a BAML project in a specific directory:
   ```
   baml init --dest /path/to/my/project
   ```

3. Initialize a BAML project for Python with Pydantic:
   ```
   baml init --client-type python/pydantic
   ```

4. Initialize a BAML project for OpenAPI with a Go client:
   ```
   baml init --client-type openapi --openapi-client-type go
   ```

## Notes

- If the destination directory already contains a `baml_src` directory, the command will fail to prevent overwriting existing projects.
- The command attempts to infer the OpenAPI generator command based on what's available in your system PATH. It checks for `openapi-generator`, `openapi-generator-cli`, or falls back to using `npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli`.
- After initialization, follow the instructions provided in the console output for language-specific setup steps.
