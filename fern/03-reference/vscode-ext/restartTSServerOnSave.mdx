| `boolean` | `true` |

## Docs

- `true`: Automatically restarts the TypeScript Language Server in VSCode when the BAML extension generates the TypeScript `baml_client` files. This is a workaround for VSCode's issues with recognizing newly added directories and files in the TypeScript Language Server. No-op if not generating TypeScript files.
- `false`: Does not automatically restart the TypeScript Server. You may need to manually reload the TS server to ensure it recognizes the new types.

## Usage

```json
{
  "baml.restartTSServerOnSave": true
}
```
