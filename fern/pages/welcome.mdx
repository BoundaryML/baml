**BAML is a domain-specific language to generate structured outputs from LLMs -- with the best developer experience.**

With BAML you can build reliable Agents, Chatbots with RAG, extract data from PDFs, and more.

### A small sample of features:
1. **An amazingly fast developer experience** for prompting in the BAML VSCode playground
1. **Fully type-safe outputs**, even when streaming structured data.
1. **Flexibility** -- it works with **any LLM**, **any language**, and **any schema**.
2. **State-of-the-art structured outputs** that [outperform other approaches and frameworks](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/sota-function-calling?q=0) -- that works even better with OpenSource models.

## Motivation

Prompts are not just f'strings. They are actual functions with logic that can become very complex to maintain and test.

We developed BAML because other tooling was not sufficient to develop prompts in a way that was type-safe, reusable, and easy to understand.
