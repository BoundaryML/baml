title: What is baml_client?
---

**baml_client** is the code that gets generated from your BAML files.

<img src="/assets/vscode/baml-client.png" width="300px"/>


To generate it you must include a generator block in any of your BAML files. Refer to the **Installation** guides for how to set this up for your language, and how to generate it.

<CodeBlocks>

```baml Python
generator target {
    // Valid values: "python/pydantic", "typescript", "ruby/sorbet"
    output_type "python/pydantic"
    
    // Where the generated code will be saved (relative to baml_src/)
    output_dir "../"
    
    // What interface you prefer to use for the generated code (sync/async)
    // Both are generated regardless of the choice, just modifies what is exported
    // at the top level
    default_client_mode "sync"
    
    // Version of runtime to generate code for (should match installed baml-py version)
    version "0.54.0"
}
```

```baml TypeScript
generator target {
    // Valid values: "python/pydantic", "typescript", "ruby/sorbet"
    output_type "typescript"
    
    // Where the generated code will be saved (relative to baml_src/)
    output_dir "../"
    
    // What interface you prefer to use for the generated code (sync/async)
    // Both are generated regardless of the choice, just modifies what is exported
    // at the top level
    default_client_mode "async"
    
    // Version of runtime to generate code for (should match the package @boundaryml/baml version)
    version "0.54.0"
}
```

```baml Ruby (beta)
generator target {
    // Valid values: "python/pydantic", "typescript", "ruby/sorbet"
    output_type "ruby/sorbet"

    // Where the generated code will be saved (relative to baml_src/)
    output_dir "../"
    
    // Version of runtime to generate code for (should match installed `baml` package version)
    version "0.54.0"
}
```

```baml OpenAPI
generator target {
    // Valid values: "python/pydantic", "typescript", "ruby/sorbet", "rest/openapi"
    output_type "rest/openapi"

    // Where the generated code will be saved (relative to baml_src/)
    output_dir "../"
    
    // Version of runtime to generate code for (should match installed `baml` package version)
    version "0.54.0"

    // 'baml-cli generate' will run this after generating openapi.yaml, to generate your OpenAPI client
    // This command will be run from within $output_dir
    on_generate "npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g OPENAPI_CLIENT_TYPE -o ."
}
```
</CodeBlocks>

The `baml_client` transforms a BAML function into the same equivalent function in your language, 
```python Python
from baml_client import b
resume_info = b.ExtractResume("....some text...")
```

This has all the boilerplate to:
1. call the LLM endpoint with the right parameters, 
2. parse the output, 
3. fix broken JSON (if any)
4. return the result in a nice typed object.
5. handle errors

It also contains the types for your functions, which are used in your code to ensure type-safety.

In Python, your BAML types get converted to Pydantic models. In Typescript, they get converted to TypeScript types, and so on. **BAML acts like a universal type system that can be used in any language**.
