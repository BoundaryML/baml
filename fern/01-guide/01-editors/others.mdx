We don't currently have any tier support for any other editors.

* JetBrains IDEs
* Helix
* Zed
* Vim
* Emacs
* Sublime Text
* Atom


Since the extension is a language server, we can technically pull out the language server and syntax highlighter and support any editor supporting the language server protocol.
If you're interested in contributing to the project and supporting another editor, [please reach out](/contact).

An alternative is to edit your files in our [Playground](https://www.promptfiddle.com/), and copy the code into your editor, but we recommend using VSCode to edit BAML files for now.
