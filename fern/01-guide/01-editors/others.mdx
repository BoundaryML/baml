We don't currently have any tier support for any other editors.

* JetBrains IDEs
* Helix
* Zed
* Vim
* Emacs
* Sublime Text
* Atom


Since the extension is a language server, we can technically pull out the language server and syntax highlighter and support any editor supporting the language server protocol.
If you're interested in contributing to the project and supporting another editor, [please reach out](/contact).
