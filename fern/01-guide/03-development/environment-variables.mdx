## Environment Variables in BAML

Sometimes you'll see environment variables used in BAML, like in clients:

```baml

client<llm> GPT4o {
  provider baml-openai-chat
  options {
    model gpt-4o
    api_key env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
}
```

## Dynamically setting LLM API Keys
You can set the API key for an LLM dynamically by passing in the key as a header or as a parameter (depending on the provider), using the [ClientRegistry](/reference/client-registry).
