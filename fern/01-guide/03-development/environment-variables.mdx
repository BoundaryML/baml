## Environment Variables in BAML

Sometimes you'll see environment variables used in BAML, like in clients:

```baml

client<llm> GPT4o {
  provider baml-openai-chat
  options {
    model gpt-4o
    api_key env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
}
```

BAML will expect these to be set already in your program **before** you import the baml_client in Python/ TS / etc.

Any of the following strategies for setting env vars are compatible with BAML:
  - setting them in your shell before running your program
  - in your `Dockerfile`
  - in your `next.config.js`
  - in your Kubernetes manifest
  - from secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
  - from a secrets provider such as [Infisical](https://infisical.com/) / [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/)
  - from a `.env` file (using `dotenv` cli)
  - using account credentials for ephemeral token generation (e.g. Vertex AI Auth Tokens)

## Loading environment variables manually

<Info>
This is available in Baml Version 0.57+
</Info>

If you don't want BAML to try to auto-load your env vars, you can call manually `reset_baml_env_vars`
with the current environment variables.
<CodeBlocks>

```python Python

from baml_client import b
from baml_client import reset_baml_env_vars
import os
import dotenv

dotenv.load_dotenv()
reset_baml_env_vars(dict(os.environ))
```

```typescript TypeScript
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
// Wait to import the BAML client until after loading environment variables
import { b, resetBamlEnvVars } from 'baml-client'

dotenv.config()
resetBamlEnvVars(process.env)
```

```ruby Ruby (beta)
require 'dotenv/load'

# Wait to import the BAML client until after loading environment variables
# reset_baml_env_vars is not yet implemented in the Ruby client
require 'baml_client'
```

## Dynamically setting LLM API Keys
You can set the API key for an LLM dynamically by passing in the key as a header or as a parameter (depending on the provider), using the [ClientRegistry](/reference/client-registry).
