title: Upgrading BAML / Fixing Version Mismatches
---

Remember that the generated `baml_client` code is generated by your `baml_py` / `@boundaryml/baml` package dependency (using `baml-cli generate`), but can also be generated by the VSCode extension when you save a BAML file.

**To upgrade BAML versions:**
1. Update the `generator` clause in your `generators.baml` file (or wherever you have it defined) to the new version. If you ran `baml-cli init`, one has already been generated for you!
```baml generators.baml
generator TypescriptGenerator {
    output_type "typescript"
    ....
    // Version of runtime to generate code for (should match the package @boundaryml/baml version)
    version "0.62.0"
}
```

2. Update your `baml_py`  / `@boundaryml/baml` package dependency to the same version.


<CodeBlock>
```sh pip
pip install --upgrade baml-py
```
```sh npm
npm install @boundaryml/baml@latest
```

```sh ruby
gem install baml
```
</CodeBlock>

3. Update VSCode BAML extension to point to the same version. Read here for how to keep VSCode in sync with your `baml_py` / `@boundaryml/baml` package dependency: [VSCode BAML Extension reference](/guide/reference/vscode-ext/clipath)

You only need to do this for minor version upgrades (e.g., 0.54.0 -> 0.62.0), not patch versions (e.g., 0.62.0 -> 0.62.1).



## Troubleshooting

See the [VSCode BAML Extension reference](/guide/reference/vscode-ext/clipath) for more information on how to prevent version mismatches.
