To set up BAML with Ruby do the following:

<Steps>
  ### Install BAML VSCode Extension
      https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=boundary.baml-extension

      - syntax highlighting
      - testing playground
      - prompt previews
  
  ### Install BAML
      ```bash bundle
      bundle add baml sorbet-runtime
      ```
  
  ### Add BAML to your existing project
      This will give you some starter BAML code in a `baml_src` directory.

      ```bash
      bundle exec baml-cli init
      ```
  
  ### Generate Ruby code from `.baml` files

    ```bash
    bundle exec baml-cli generate
    ```
    `
    See [What is baml_src](/guide/introduction/baml_src) to learn more about how this works.

    As fun as writing BAML is, we want you be able to leverage BAML with existing ruby modules. This command gives you a ruby module that is a type-safe interface to every BAML function.

    <Tip>
      Our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Boundary.baml-extension) automatically runs this command when you save a BAML file.
    </Tip>
  
  ### Use a BAML function in Ruby!
    <Error>If `baml_client` doesn't exist, make sure to run the previous step!</Error>

    <CodeBlocks>
    ```ruby main.rb
    require_relative "baml_client/client"

    def example(raw_resume)
        # r is an instance of Baml::Types::Resume, defined in baml_client/types
        r = Baml.Client.ExtractResume(resume: raw_resume)

        puts "ExtractResume response:"
        puts r.inspect
    end

    def example_stream(raw_resume)
        stream = Baml.Client.stream.ExtractResume(resume: raw_resume)

        stream.each do |msg|
            # msg is an instance of Baml::PartialTypes::Resume
            # defined in baml_client/partial_types
            puts msg.inspect
        end

        stream.get_final_response
    end

    example 'Grace Hopper created COBOL'
    example_stream 'Grace Hopper created COBOL'
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>
</Steps>
