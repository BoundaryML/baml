To set up BAML with Python do the following:

<Steps>
  ### Install BAML VSCode/Cursor Extension
      https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=boundary.baml-extension

      - syntax highlighting
      - testing playground
      - prompt previews

      <Tip>
      In your VSCode User Settings, highly recommend adding this to get better autocomplete for python in general, not just BAML.

      ```json
      {
        "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic"
      }
      ```
      </Tip>
  
  ### Install BAML
      <CodeBlocks>
        ```bash pip
        pip install baml-py
        ```

        ```bash poetry
        poetry add baml-py
        ```
        </CodeBlocks>
  
  ### Add BAML to your existing project
      This will give you some starter BAML code in a `baml_src` directory.

      <CodeBlocks>
      ```bash pip
      baml-cli init
      ```

      ```bash poetry
      poetry run baml-cli init
      ```
      </CodeBlocks>
  
  ### Generate the `baml_client` python module from `.baml` files

    <CodeBlocks>
    ```bash pip
    baml-cli generate
    ```


    ```bash poetry
    poetry run baml-cli generate
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>

    See [What is baml_src](/guide/introduction/baml_src) to learn more about how this works.

    As fun as writing BAML is, we want you be able to leverage BAML with existing python modules. This command gives you a python module that is a type-safe (mypy / ruff / pylance analyzeable) interface to every BAML function.

    <Tip>
      If you set up the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Boundary.baml-extension), it will automatically run `baml-cli generate` on saving a BAML file.
    </Tip>

  
  ### Use a BAML function in Python!
    <Error>If `baml_client` doesn't exist, make sure to run the previous step! </Error>

    <CodeBlocks>
    ```python main.py
    from baml_client.sync_client import b
    from baml_client.types import Resume

    def example(raw_resume: str) -> Resume: 
      # BAML's internal parser guarantees ExtractResume
      # to be always return a Resume type
      response = b.ExtractResume(raw_resume)
      return response

    def example_stream(raw_resume: str) -> Resume:
      stream = b.stream.ExtractResume(raw_resume)
      for msg in stream:
        print(msg) # This will be a PartialResume type
      
      # This will be a Resume type
      final = stream.get_final_response()

      return final
    ```

    ```python async_main.py
    from baml_client.async_client import b
    from baml_client.types import Resume

    async def example(raw_resume: str) -> Resume: 
      # BAML's internal parser guarantees ExtractResume
      # to be always return a Resume type
      response = await b.ExtractResume(raw_resume)
      return response

    async def example_stream(raw_resume: str) -> Resume:
      stream = b.stream.ExtractResume(raw_resume)
      async for msg in stream:
        print(msg) # This will be a PartialResume type
      
      # This will be a Resume type
      final = stream.get_final_response()

      return final
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>
  
</Steps>


## BAML with Jupyter Notebooks

You can use the baml_client in a Jupyter notebook. 

One of the common problems is making sure your code changes are picked up by the notebook without having to restart the whole kernel (and re-run all the cells)

**To make sure your changes in .baml files are reflected in your notebook you must do these steps:**

<Steps>
### Setup the autoreload extension

```python cell0
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```
This will make sure to reload imports, such as baml_client's "b" object before every cell runs.

### Import baml_client module in your notebook

Note it's different from how we import in python.
```python cell1
# Assuming your baml_client is inside a dir called app/
import app.baml_client as client # you can name this "llm" or "baml" or whatever you want
```

Usually we import things as 
`from baml_client import b`, and we can call our functions using `b`, but the `%autoreload` notebook extension does not work well with `from...import` statements.


### Call BAML functions using the module name as a prefix

```python cell2
raw_resume = "Here's some resume text"
client.b.ExtractResume(raw_resume)
```
Now your changes in .baml files are reflected in your notebook automatically, without needing to restart the Jupyter kernel.

<Note>
If you want to keep using the `from baml_client import b` style, you'll just need to re-import it everytime you regenerate the baml_client.
</Note>

<Warning>
Pylance will complain about any schema changes you make in .baml files. You can ignore these errors. If you want it to pick up your new types, you'll need to restart the kernel.
This auto-reload approach works best if you're only making changes to the prompts.
</Warning>

</Steps>
