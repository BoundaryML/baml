title: A BAML AI function
---
BAML helps you write prompts as `functions` that you can use in your application. The BAML compiler translates these to REST requests to call the LLM provider endpoints, and parse the output to get the **guaranteed output type** you want.

Here is a simple BAML function to extract a resume. Note the input is a chunk of resume_text, and the output is an actual `Resume` class. Read [prompt syntax](../prompt-syntax/what-is-jinja.mdx) to learn more about the prompt and what Jinja templating is.

```rust BAML
class Resume {
  name string
  education Education[] @description("Extract in the same order listed")
  skills string[] @description("Only include programming languages")
}

class Education {
  school string
  degree string
  year int
}

function ExtractResume(resume_text: string) -> Resume {
  client GPT4Turbo
  // The prompt uses Jinja syntax. Change the models or this text and watch the prompt preview change!
  prompt #"
    Parse the following resume and return a structured representation of the data in the schema below.

    Resume:
    ---
    {{ resume_text }}
    ---

    {# special macro to print the output instructions. #}
    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    JSON:
  "#
}
```

If you are using VSCode extension, you can see the how the prompt is rendered, and what `ctx.output_format` is:

And you can dive even deeper to see the **Raw CURL request** BAML will make to the LLM provider:

## Calling the function
Recall that BAML will generate a `baml_client` in the language of your choice using the parameters in your `generator` config.

This client will contain the same function as you defined in your BAML file, and you can call it like any other function.

BAML's fuzzy parser will fix any common json mistakes LLMs make.

<CodeBlocks>
```python python
from baml_client import b
from baml_client.types import Resume

async def main():
resume_text = """Jason Doe\nPython, Rust\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, B.S.\nin Computer Science, 2020\nAlso an expert in Tableau, SQL, and C++\n"""

    # this function comes from the autogenerated "baml_client".
    # It calls the LLM you specified and handles the parsing.
    resume = await b.ExtractResume(resume_text)

    # Fully type-checked and validated!
    assert isinstance(resume, Resume)

```

```typescript typescript
import b from 'baml_client'

async function main() {
  const resume_text = `Jason Doe\nPython, Rust\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, B.S.\nin Computer Science, 2020\nAlso an expert in Tableau, SQL, and C++`

  // this function comes from the autogenerated "baml_client".
  // It calls the LLM you specified and handles the parsing.
  const resume = await b.ExtractResume(resume_text)

  // Fully type-checked and validated!
  resume.name === 'Jason Doe'
}
```

```ruby ruby

require_relative "baml_client/client"
b = Baml.Client

# Note this is not async
res = b.TestFnNamedArgsSingleClass(
    myArg: Baml::Types::Resume.new(
        key: "key",
        key_two: true,
        key_three: 52,
    )
)
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Complex input types

If you have a complex input type you can import them from `baml_client` and use them when calling your function. Imagine we injected `class Resume` into a different baml function called AnalyzeResume. Here's what the call looks like:

<CodeBlocks>
```python Python
from baml_client.types import Resume
from baml_client import b
...
  await b.AnalyzeResume(
    Resume(name="Mark", education=[...]))

````

```typescript typescript
import { Resume, b } from "baml_client"

...
  await b.AnalyzeResume({
    name: "Mark",
    education: [...]
  })
````

```ruby Ruby
require_relative "baml_client/client"
b = Baml.Client
...
res = b.AnalyzeResume(
  myArg: Baml::Types::Resume.new(
      name: "key",
      education: [...]
  )
)
```

</CodeBlocks>
