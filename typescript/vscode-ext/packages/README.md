# Baml Language VS Code Extension

This VS Code extension provides support for the Baml language used to define LLM functions, test them in the integrated LLM Playground and build agentic workflows.

### General features

1. **Syntax Highlighting**: Provides enhanced readability and coding experience by highlighting the Baml language syntax for any file with the `.baml` extension.
2. **Dynamic playground**: Run and test your prompts in real-time.
3. **Build typed clients in several languages**: Command +S a baml file to build a baml client to call your functions in Python or TS.


## Usage
