# NOTE(sam): I use this on my own laptop, so that `cargo build` doesn't have
# to fight rust-analyzer for the build directory lock.
# 
# To get the same, add this to your VSCode settings:
#
#    "rust-analyzer.cargo.targetDir": "./target-rust-analyzer",
#
# I'm not turning it on for everyone, because this is expensive compute/storage wise.

# These are backup files generated by rustfmt
**/*.rs.bk

# MSVC Windows builds of rustc generate these, which store debugging information
*.pdb

#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
