## Overview

We recommend starting with the [first tutorial](https://docs.boundaryml.com/v3/guides/hello_world/level1), and then looking at the chatbot_example directory here afterwards.

To run the chatbot example for a first glance at what BAML can do, setup your open AI key in an .env file and run:
`python -m chatbot_example`

To run the tests:
`python -m pytest`
