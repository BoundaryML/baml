title: "Test an AI function"
---


There are two types of tests you may want to run on your AI functions:

- Unit Tests: Tests a single AI function
- Integration Tests: Tests a pipeline of AI functions and potentially buisness logic

We support both types of tests using BAML. See the next tutorials for more advanced testing capabilities.

## Test using the playground

Use the playground to run tests against individual function impls. The playground allows a type-safe interface for creating tests along with running them.
Under the hood, the playground runs `baml test` for you and writes the test files to the `__tests__` folder (see below).

<Note>
Note we currently don't support assertions in these tests -- they must be manually evaluated by a human. Read the next tutorials to learn how to write more advanced tests with different kinds of assertions, including LLM-powered evaluation.
</Note>
## Create a test from an existing production request
Use Boundary studio to import an existing request into a test you can run on the VSCode playground. It's a 1-click import process.

## Creating tests manually

Unit tests created by the playground are stored in the `__tests__` folder.

The project structure should look like this:

```bash
.
├── baml_client/
└── baml_src/
    ├── __tests__/
    │   ├── YourAIFunction/
    │   │   ├── test_name_monkey.json
    │   │   └── test_name_cricket.json
    │   └── YourAIFunction2/
    │       └── test_name_jellyfish.json
    ├── main.baml
    └── foo.baml
```

You can manually create tests by creating a folder for each function you want to test. Inside each folder, create a json file for each test case you want to run. The json file should be named `test_name.json` where `test_name` is the name of the test case.

To see the structure of the JSON file, you can create a test using the playground and then copy the JSON file into your project.

<Tip>
  The BAML compiler reads the `__tests__` folder and generates a pytest file for
  you so you don't have to manually write test boilerplate code.

## Run Playground tests from the terminal

You can also use the BAML CLI to run Playground tests. This is useful if you want to run tests in a CI/CD pipeline. 

The command to run is `baml test`. You can run it from the root of your project.

```bash
# List all tests
$ baml test
================= 3/3 tests selected (0 deselected) =================
ClassifyDocumentTopic (impls: simpleclassifydocumenttopic) (1 tests)
  combined_aquamarine ○
GetNextQuestion (impls: v1) (1 tests)
  beneficial_moccasin ○
================= 3/3 tests selected (0 deselected) =================

# Run all tests
$ baml test run

# Run tests for a specific function
$ baml test -i "MyFunction:" run

# Run tests for a specific function impl
$ baml test -i "MyFunction:v1" run

# Run a specific test case.
$ baml test -i "::smoky_monkey" run

# Run all tests except for a specific test case.
$ baml test -x "::smoky_monkey" run

# Help
$ baml test --help
```

<Tip>
  Execute `baml test` (without "run" part)  to see what tests will be run.
