title: "Test an AI function"
---


There are two types of tests you may want to run on your AI functions:

- Unit Tests: Tests a single AI function (using the playground)
- Integration Tests: Tests a pipeline of AI functions and potentially buisness logic

For integration tests, see the [Integration Testing Guide](/docs/guides/testing/test_with_assertions).
