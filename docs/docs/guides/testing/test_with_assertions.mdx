title: "Evaluate results with assertions or using LLM Evals"

# Python guide
To add assertions to your tests, or add more complex testing scenarios, you can use pytest to test your functions, since Playground BAML tests don't currently support assertions.

### Example
```python test_file.py
from baml_client import baml as b
from baml_client.types import Email
import pytest

# Run `poetry run pytest -m baml_test` in this directory.
# Setup Boundary Studio to see test details!
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_order_info():
  order_info = await b.GetOrderInfo(Email(
      subject="Order #1234",
      body="Your order has been shipped. It will arrive on 1st Jan 2022. Product: iPhone 13. Cost: $999.99"
  ))

  assert order_info.cost == 999.99
```
<Warning>
  Make sure your test file, the Test class AND/or the test function is prefixed with `Test` or `test` respectively. Otherwise, pytest will not pick up your tests. E.g. `test_foo.py`, `TestFoo`, `test_foo`
</Warning>


Run `pytest -k 'order_info'` to run this test. To show have pytest show print statements add the `-s` flag. 

<Note>
  Make sure you are running these commands from your python virtual environment
  (or **`poetry shell`** if you use poetry)
</Note>

### Using an LLM eval
You can also declare a new BAML function that you can use in your tests to validate results.

This is helpful for testing more ambiguous LLM free-form text generations. You can measure anything from sentiment, to the tone of of the text.

For example, the following GPT-4-powered function can be used in your tests to assert that a given generated sentence is professional-sounding:

```rust
enum ProfessionalismRating {
  GREAT
  OK
  BAD
}

function ValidateProfessionalism(input: string) -> ProfessionalismRating {
  client GPT4
  prompt #"
    Is this text professional-sounding?

    Use the following scale:
    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    Sentence: {{ input }}

    ProfessionalismRating:
  "#
}
```

```python
from baml_client import baml as b
from baml_client.types import Email, ProfessionalismRating
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_message_professionalism():
  order_info = await b.GetOrderInfo(Email(
      subject="Order #1234",
      body="Your order has been shipped. It will arrive on 1st Jan 2022. Product: iPhone 13. Cost: $999.99"
  ))

  assert order_info.cost == 999.99

  professionalism_rating = await b.ValidateProfessionalism(order_info.body)
  assert professionalism_rating == b.ProfessionalismRating.GREAT
```
