### Streaming partial objects
The following returns an object that slowly gets filled in as the response comes in. This is useful if you want to start processing the response before it's fully complete.
You can stream anything from a `string` output type, to a complex object.

Example:
```
{"prop1": "hello"}
{"prop1": "hello how are you"}
{"prop1": "hello how are you", "prop2": "I'm good, how are you?"}
{"prop1": "hello how are you", "prop2": "I'm good, how are you?", "prop3": "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!"}
```

### Python
```python FastAPI
from baml_client import b

@app.get("/extract_resume")
async def extract_resume(resume_text: str):
    async def stream_resume(resume):
        stream = b.stream.ExtractResume(resume_text)
        async for chunk in stream:
            yield str(chunk.model_dump_json()) + "\n"
                
    return StreamingResponse(stream_resume(resume), media_type="text/plain")
```


### TypeScript
```typescript
import { b } from '../baml_client'; // or whatever path baml_client is in

export async function streamText() {
    const stream = b.stream.MyFunction(MyInput(...));
    for await (const output of stream) {
        console.log(`streaming: ${output}`); // this is the output type of my function
    }

    const finalOutput = await stream.getFinalResponse();
    console.log(`final response: ${finalOutput}`);
}
```
