title: "BAML Project Structure"
---

At a high level, you will define your AI prompts and interfaces in BAML files.
The BAML compiler will then generate Python or Typescript code for you to use in
your application, depending on the generators configured in your `main.baml`:

```rust main.baml
generator MyGenerator{
  output_type typescript
  output_dir "../"
}
```

Here is the typical project structure:

```bash
.
├── baml_client/ # Generated code
├── baml_src/ # Prompts and baml tests live here
│   └── foo.baml
# The rest of your project (not generated nor used by BAML)
├── app/
│  ├── __init__.py
│  └── main.py
└── pyproject.toml

```

1. `baml_src/` is where you write your BAML files with the AI
function declarations, prompts, retry policies, etc. It also contains
[generator](/docs/syntax/generator) blocks which configure how and where to
transpile your BAML code.

2. `baml_client/` is where the BAML compiler will generate code for you,
based on the types and functions you define in your BAML code. Here's how you'd access the generated functions from baml_client:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from baml_client import baml as b

async def use_llm_for_task():
  await b.CallMyLLM()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import b from '@/baml_client'

const use_llm_for_task = async () => {
  await b.CallMyLLM();
};
```
</CodeGroup>


<Warning>
  **You should never edit any files inside baml_client directory** as the whole
  directory gets regenerated on every `baml build` (auto runs on save if using
  the VSCode extension).
</Warning>

<Tip>
  If you ever run into any issues with the generated code (like merge
  conflicts), you can always delete the `baml_client` directory and it will get
  regenerated automatically on save.
</Tip>

### imports

BAML by default has global imports. Every entity declared in any `.baml` file is available to all other `.baml` files under the same `baml_src` directory. You **can** have multiple `baml_src` directories, but no promises on how the VSCode extension will behave (yet).
