title: "Testing AI functions"
---


One important way to ensure your AI functions are working as expected is to write unit tests. This is especially important when you're working with AI functions that are used in production, or when you're working with a team.

To test functions:
1. Install the VSCode extension
2. Create a test in any .baml file:
```rust
test MyTest {
  functions [ExtractResume]
  args {
    resume_text "hello"
  }
}

```
3. Run the test in the VSCode extension!

We have more capabilities like assertions coming soon!
