Classes consist of a name, a list of properties, and their [types](/docs/snippets/supported-types).
In the context of LLMs, classes describe the type of the variables you can inject into prompts and extract out from the response.

  Note properties have no `:`

<CodeGroup>
```llvm Baml
class Foo {
  property1 string
  property2 int?
  property3 Bar[]
  property4 MyEnum
}
```

```python Python Equivalent
from pydantic import BaseModel
from path.to.bar import Bar
from path.to.my_enum import MyEnum

class Foo(BaseModel):
  property1: str
  property2: Optional[int]= None
  property3: List[Bar]
  property4: MyEnum
```

```typescript Typescript Equivalent
import z from "zod";
import { BarZod } from "./path/to/bar";
import { MyEnumZod } from "./path/to/my_enum";

const FooZod = z.object({
  property1: z.string(),
  property2: z.number().int().nullable().optional(),
  property3: z.array(BarZod),
  property4: MyEnumZod,
});

type Foo = z.infer<typeof FooZod>;
```

</CodeGroup>

## aliases, descriptions

When prompt engineering, you can also alias fields  and add descriptions:
```rust
class Foo {
  summary string @alias("complete_summary") @description("Answer in 2 sentences")
}
```
Aliasing renames the field for the llm to potentially "understand" your property better, while keeping the original name in your code, so you don't need to change your code everytime.

See more in [prompt syntax docs](./prompt_engineering/class)

## Constraints

Classes may have any number of properties.
Property names must follow these rules:
- Must start with a letter
- Must contain only letters, numbers, and underscores
- Must be unique within the class
- classes cannot be self-referential (cannot have a property of the same type as the class itself)

The type of a property can be any [supported type](/docs/snippets/supported-types)

### Default values

- Not yet supported. For optional properties, the default value is `None` in python.

## Inheritance

Not supported. Like rust, we take the stance that [composition is better than inheritance](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/composition-vs-inheritance).
