You can test your BAML functions in the VSCode Playground by adding a `test` snippet into a BAML file:

```baml
enum Category {
    Refund
    CancelOrder
    TechnicalSupport
    AccountIssue
    Question
}

function ClassifyMessage(input: string) -> Category {
  client GPT4Turbo
  prompt #"
    ... truncated ...
  "#
}

test Test1 {
  functions [ClassifyMessage]
  args {
    input "Can't access my account using my usual login credentials, and each attempt results in an error message stating 'Invalid username or password.' I have tried resetting my password using the 'Forgot Password' link, but I haven't received the promised password reset email."
  }
}
```
See the [interactive examples](https://promptfiddle.com)

The BAML playground will give you a starting snippet to copy that will match your function signature.

<Warning>
BAML doesn't use between key-value pairs `:` except in function parameters
</Warning>

## Complex object inputs

Objects are injected as dictionaries
```baml
class Message {
  user string
  content string
}

function ClassifyMessage(messages: Messages[]) -> Category {
...
}

test Test1 {
  functions [ClassifyMessage]
  args {
    messages [
      {
        user "hey there"
        content #"
          You can also add a multi-line
          string with the hashtags
          Instead of ugly json with \n
        "#
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Images

For a function that takes an image as input, like so:

```baml
function MyFunction(myImage: image) -> string {
  client GPT4o
  prompt #"
    Describe this image: {{myImage}}
  "#
}
```

You can define test cases using image files, URLs, or base64 strings.

### Using a file

<Warning>
  Committing a lot of images into your repository can make it slow to clone and
  pull your repository. If you expect to commit >500MiB of images, please read
  [GitHub's size limit documentation][github-large-files] and consider setting
  up [large file storage][github-lfs].
</Warning>

[github-large-files]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github
[github-lfs]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/configuring-git-large-file-storage

```baml
test Test1 {
  functions [MyFunction]
  args {
    myImage {
      file "../path/to/image.png"
    }
  }
}
```

<ParamField path="file" type="string" required="true">
  The path to the image file, relative to the directory containing the current BAML file.

  Image files must be somewhere in `baml_src/`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="media_type" type="string">
  The mime-type of the image. If not set, and the provider expects a mime-type
  to be provided, BAML will try to infer it based on first, the file extension,
  and second, the contents of the file.
</ParamField>

### Using a URL
```baml
test Test1 {
  functions [MyFunction]
  args {
    myImage {
      url "https...."
    }
  }
}
```

<ParamField path="url" type="string" required="true">
  The publicly accessible URL from which the image may be downloaded.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="media_type" type="string">
  The mime-type of the image. If not set, and the provider expects a mime-type
  to be provided, BAML will try to infer it based on the contents of the file.
</ParamField>

### Using a base64 string
```baml
test Test1 {
  args {
    myImage {
      base64 "base64string"
      media_type "image/png"
    }
  }
}
```

<ParamField path="base64" type="string" required="true">
  The base64-encoded image data.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="media_type" type="string">
  The mime-type of the image. If not set, and the provider expects a mime-type
  to be provided, BAML will try to infer it based on the contents of the file.

  If `base64` is a data URL, this field will be ignored.
</ParamField>


## Audio

For a function that takes audio as input, like so:

```baml
function MyFunction(myAudio: audio) -> string {
  client GPT4o
  prompt #"
    Describe this audio: {{myAudio}}
  "#
}
```

You can define test cases using audio files, URLs, or base64 strings.

### Using a file

<Warning>
  Committing a lot of audio files into your repository can make it slow to clone and
  pull your repository. If you expect to commit >500MiB of audio, please read
  [GitHub's size limit documentation][github-large-files] and consider setting
  up [large file storage][github-lfs].
</Warning>

```baml
test Test1 {
  functions [MyFunction]
  args {
    myAudio {
      file "../path/to/audio.mp3"
    }
  }
}
```

<ParamField path="file" type="string" required="true">
  The path to the audio file, relative to the directory containing the current BAML file.

  audio files must be somewhere in `baml_src/`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="media_type" type="string">
  The mime-type of the audio. If not set, and the provider expects a mime-type
  to be provided, BAML will try to infer it based on first, the file extension,
  and second, the contents of the file.
</ParamField>

### Using a URL
```baml
test Test1 {
  functions [MyFunction]
  args {
    myAudio {
      url "https...."
    }
  }
}
```

<ParamField path="url" type="string" required="true">
  The publicly accessible URL from which the audio may be downloaded.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="media_type" type="string">
  The mime-type of the audio. If not set, and the provider expects a mime-type
  to be provided, BAML will try to infer it based on the contents of the file.
</ParamField>

### Using a base64 string
```baml
test Test1 {
  args {
    myAudio {
      base64 "base64string"
      media_type "audio/mp3"
    }
  }
}
```

<ParamField path="base64" type="string" required="true">
  The base64-encoded audio data.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="media_type" type="string">
  The mime-type of the audio. If not set, and the provider expects a mime-type
  to be provided, BAML will try to infer it based on the contents of the file.

  If `base64` is a data URL, this field will be ignored.
</ParamField>
