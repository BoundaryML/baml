title: Others (e.g. openrouter)
---

Since many model providers are settling on following the OpenAI Chat API spec, the recommended way to use them is to use the `openai` provider.

Please report an [issue](https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml/issues) if you encounter something that doesn't work as expected.

## Examples

### OpenRouter

https://openrouter.ai - A unified interface for LLMs

```rust BAML
client<llm> MyClient {
  provider openai
  options {
    base_url "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
    api_key env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY
    model "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
    headers {
      "HTTP-Referer" "YOUR-SITE-URL" // Optional
      "X-Title" "YOUR-TITLE" // Optional
    }
  }
}
```
