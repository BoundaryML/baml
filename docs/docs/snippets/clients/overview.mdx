Clients are used to configure how LLMs are called, like so:

```rust BAML
function MakeHaiku(topic: string) -> string {
  client "openai/gpt-4o"
  prompt #"
    Write a haiku about {{ topic }}.
  "#
}
```

This is `<provider>/<model>` shorthand for:

```rust BAML
client<llm> MyClient {
  provider "openai"
  options {
    model "gpt-4o"
    // api_key defaults to env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
}

function MakeHaiku(topic: string) -> string {
  client MyClient
  prompt #"
    Write a haiku about {{ topic }}.
  "#
}
```

Consult the [provider documentation](#fields) for a list of supported providers
and models, and the default options.

If you want to override options like `api_key` to use a different environment
variable, or you want to point `base_url` to a different endpoint, you should use
the latter form.

<Tip>
If you want to specify which client to use at runtime, in your Python/TS/Ruby code,
you can use the [client registry](/docs/calling-baml/client-registry) to do so.

This can come in handy if you're trying to, say, send 10% of your requests to a
different model.
