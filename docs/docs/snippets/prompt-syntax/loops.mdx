Here's how you can iterate over a list of items, accessing each item's attributes:

```jinja2
function MyFunc(messages: Message[]) -> string {
  prompt #"
    {% for message in messages %}
      {{ message.user_name }}: {{ message.content }}
    {% endfor %}
  "#
}
```

## loop

Jinja provides a `loop` object that can be used to access information about the loop. Here are some of the attributes of the `loop` object:


| Variable         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| loop.index       | The current iteration of the loop. (1 indexed)                              |
| loop.index0      | The current iteration of the loop. (0 indexed)                              |
| loop.revindex    | The number of iterations from the end of the loop (1 indexed)               |
| loop.revindex0   | The number of iterations from the end of the loop (0 indexed)               |
| loop.first       | True if first iteration.                                                    |
| loop.last        | True if last iteration.                                                     |
| loop.length      | The number of items in the sequence.                                        |
| loop.cycle       | A helper function to cycle between a list of sequences. See the explanation below. |
| loop.depth       | Indicates how deep in a recursive loop the rendering currently is. Starts at level 1 |
| loop.depth0      | Indicates how deep in a recursive loop the rendering currently is. Starts at level 0 |
| loop.previtem    | The item from the previous iteration of the loop. Undefined during the first iteration. |
| loop.nextitem    | The item from the following iteration of the loop. Undefined during the last iteration. |
| loop.changed(*val) | True if previously called with a different value (or not called at all).  |

```jinja2
prompt #"
  {% for item in items %}
    {{ loop.index }}: {{ item }}
  {% endfor %}
"#
