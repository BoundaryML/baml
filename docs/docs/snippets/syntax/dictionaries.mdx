Dictionaries in BAML have this syntax. You'll see them mainly in `tests` declared in BAML, and `clients`.

```nginx BAML
{
  key1 value1
  key2 {
    nestedKey1 nestedValue1
  }
}
```
Note they do not use `:`

You can use unquoted or quoted strings, booleans, numbers and nested dictionaries as values.

```nginx BAML
{
  key1 "value1"
  key2 {
    nestedKey1 1
    nestedKey2 true
  }
}
```

**Dictionary with multiline string as a value**:

```baml BAML
{
  key1 #"
    This is a 
    multiline string
  "#
}
```
