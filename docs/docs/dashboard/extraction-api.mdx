The Boundary Extraction API can be used independently of BAML to extract structured data from any document or file type.


<Warning>
Try it out at [dashboard.boundaryml.com](the Boundary Dashboard). Note that the link is currently a different portal than [Boundary Observability Studio](app.boundaryml.com). We will unify these tools soon.
