_Learn how to host your BAML functions on Boundary Functions and call them over HTTP._

<Info>
  This is a preview feature, available starting with `baml-cli v0.63.0`.
</Info>

<Note>
  The BAML language, compiler, and runtime will always be 100% free and
  open-source: we will always allow you to run BAML functions directly in your
  own backends.
  
  Boundary Functions' goal is to make it even easier to host and run BAML
  functions, by adding support for features like rate limits, telemetry, and
  end-user feedback.
</Note>

Boundary Functions allows you to host your BAML functions on our infrastructure, exposing
one REST API endpoint per BAML function.

This guide will walk you through:

  - creating a Boundary Cloud account,
  - deploying your BAML code to Boundary Functions,
  - setting your API keys, and
  - calling your BAML functions.

Once you've deployed your BAML functions, you can use the [OpenAPI client] to
call them.

[OpenAPI client]: /docs/get-started/quickstart/openapi

## Get Started

First, create your account and organization:

```bash
baml-cli login
```

Then, run this command in your `baml_src/` directory:

```bash
baml-cli deploy
```

which will point you to the dashboard, where you can set environment variables and create API keys.

</div>

Once you've set the environment variables you need (probably `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
and/or `OPENAI_API_KEY`), you can call your BAML functions!

If you still have the `ExtractResume` function that your BAML project was created with,
you can use this command to test it out:

```bash
curl https://api2.boundaryml.com/v3/functions/prod/call/ExtractResume \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOUNDARY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- << EOF
{
  "resume": "

    - Compiler development
  "
}
EOF
```

Congratulations! You've gotten your first BAML functions working on Boundary Functions.

## Local development and testing

To test your BAML functions locally, you can use `baml-cli dev`:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... OPENAI_API_KEY=... baml-cli dev
```

which will allow you to call your functions at `http://localhost:2024/call/<function_name>` instead of
`https://api2.boundaryml.com/v3/functions/prod/call/<function_name>`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:2024/functions/prod/call/ExtractResume \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOUNDARY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- << EOF
{
  "resume": "
