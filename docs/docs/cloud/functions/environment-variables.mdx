_Learn how to use Boundary Cloud Environment Variables, which are key-value pairs
configured outside your source code._

Environment variables are key-value pairs, configured outside your source code,
and used to provide secrets for your deployed BAML functions, such as
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

You can set environment variables in the [Boundary
Dashboard](https://dashboard.boundaryml.com/) by going to the left sidebar and
clicking on the cloud icon.

<div class="flex flex-col items-center">
  <img src="/assets/cloud/set-env-vars.png" alt="Boundary Cloud secrets" />
</div>

Changes to environment variables will take effect immediately.
