title: "enum"

Enums are useful for classification tasks. BAML has helper functions that can help you serialize an enum into your prompt in a neatly formatted list (more on that later).

To define your own custom enum in BAML:

<CodeGroup>
```rust BAML
enum MyEnum {
  Value1
  Value2
  Value3
}
```

```python Python Equivalent
from enum import StrEnum

class MyEnum(StrEnum):
  Value1 = "Value1"
  Value2 = "Value2"
  Value3 = "Value3"
```

```typescript Typescript Equivalent
enum MyEnum {
  Value1 = "Value1",
  Value2 = "Value2",
  Value3 = "Value3",
}
```

</CodeGroup>

- You may have as many values as you'd like.
- Values may not be duplicated or empty.
- Values may not contain spaces or special characters and must not start with a number.
