<Info>This page assumes you've already defined a function in BAML. If you
haven't done that yet, check out [how to define a function].</Info>

[how to define a function]: /docs/snippets/functions

Once you've defined a function in BAML, you need to generate code in your
language of choice to call that function: we call this generating the BAML client.

If you use VSCode, the [BAML extension] will re-generate the client every time
you save a BAML file. Otherwise, you can generate the client manually:

## Best Practices

### Define a `generator` clause

<Tip>If you created your project using `baml-cli init`, then one has already been generated for you!</Tip>

Each `generator` that you define in your BAML project will tell `baml-cli
generate` to generate code for a specific target language. You can define
multiple `generator` clauses in your BAML project, and `baml-cli generate` will
generate code for each of them.

<CodeBlocks>

```baml Python
generator target {
    // Valid values: "python/pydantic", "typescript", "rest/openapi"
    output_type "python/pydantic"
    
    // Where the generated code will be saved (relative to baml_src/)
    output_dir "../"
    
    // What interface you prefer to use for the generated code (sync/async)
    // Both are generated regardless of the choice, just modifies what is exported
    // at the top level
    default_client_mode "sync"
    
    // Version of runtime to generate code for (should match installed baml-py version)
    version "0.54.0"
}
```

```baml TypeScript
generator target {
    // Valid values: "python/pydantic", "typescript", "rest/openapi"
    output_type "typescript"
    
    // Where the generated code will be saved (relative to baml_src/)
    output_dir "../"
    
    // What interface you prefer to use for the generated code (sync/async)
    // Both are generated regardless of the choice, just modifies what is exported
    // at the top level
    default_client_mode "async"
    
    // Version of runtime to generate code for (should match the package @boundaryml/baml version)
    version "0.54.0"
}
```

```baml OpenAPI
generator target {
    // Valid values: "python/pydantic", "typescript", "rest/openapi"
    output_type "rest/openapi"

    // Where the generated code will be saved (relative to baml_src/)
    output_dir "../"
    
    // Version of runtime to generate code for (should match installed `baml` package version)
    version "0.54.0"

    // 'baml-cli generate' will run this after generating openapi.yaml, to generate your OpenAPI client
    // This command will be run from within $output_dir
    on_generate "npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g OPENAPI_CLIENT_TYPE -o ."
}
```

</CodeBlocks>
         

### Generate the BAML client on-demand

Although you can check in the generated BAML client, we recommend that you 
instead add it to your `.gitignore` and generate it on-demand when you
build/release your code:

  - this will make your PRs more readable;
  - this will save you from handling merge conflicts in generated code; and
  - this will ensure a single source-of-truth for your BAML code (and prevent
    your client from falling out of sync with your BAML code).

To add the generated client to your `.gitignore`, you can run:

```bash
echo "baml_client" >> .gitignore
```

and then you just need to run `baml-cli generate` in your CI/CD build/release
workflows. Here's what that might look like in a GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Install your Python/Node/Ruby (beta) dependencies here

      - name: Generate BAML client
        run: baml-cli generate --from baml_src
```

### Troubleshooting version conflicts

`baml_client` can be generated in 2 ways:
1. VSCode extension
2. the installed baml dependency (e.g., `baml-py`)

Since the extension auto-updates, it's possible that it stops generating the client due to a version mismatch with the `generator` version. You might see an error like:
```bash
BAML: Code Generation disabled due to version mismatch... See the fix.
```

**To fix any version mismatch issues, update all these things to the same version:**
1. VSCode extension
2. the installed baml dependency (e.g., `baml-py`)
  - python: `pip install --upgrade baml-py`
  - typescript: `npm install @boundaryml/baml@latest`
3. the `version` in your `generator` clause

Only the minor and major versions are checked for compatibility (0.0.x).

You can also tweak the generator settings below for a better experience.

#### `baml-cli generate` arguments
<ParamField
  path="--from"
  type="string"
  default="./baml_src">
Path to the BAML source directory. This is where the BAML files are located.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  path="--no-version-check"
  type="flag">
If set, it will disable checking the BAML source version with the installed BAML package version before generating code.
</ParamField>
