title: "Client Registry"
---

If you need to modify the model / paramters for an LLM client at runtime, you can modify the `ClientRegistry` for any specified function.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from baml_py import ClientRegistry

async def run():
    cr = ClientRegistry()
    # Creates a new client
    cr.add_llm_client(name='MyAmazingClient', provider='openai', options={
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "api_key": "sk-..."
    })
    # Sets MyAmazingClient as the primary client
    cr.set_primary('MyAmazingClient')

    # ExtractResume will now use MyAmazingClient as the calling client
    res = await b.ExtractResume("...", { "client_registry": cr })
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { ClientRegistry } from '@boundaryml/baml'

async function run() {
    const cr = new ClientRegistry()
    // Creates a new client
    cr.addLLMClient({ name: 'MyAmazingClient', provider: 'openai', options: {
        model: "gpt-4o",
        temperature: 0.7,
        api_key: "sk-..."
    }})
    // Sets MyAmazingClient as the primary client
    cr.setPrimary('MyAmazingClient')

    // ExtractResume will now use MyAmazingClient as the calling client
    const res = await b.ExtractResume("...", { clientRegistry: cr })
}
```

## ClientRegistry Interface
import ClientConstructorParams from '/snippets/client-params.mdx'


<Tip>
    Note: `ClientRegistry` is imported from `baml_py` in Python and `@boundaryml/baml` in TypeScript, not `baml_client`.

    As we mature `ClientRegistry`, we will add a more type-safe and ergonomic interface directly in `baml_client`. See [Github issue #766](https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml/issues/766).
</Tip>

Methods use `snake_case` in Python and `camelCase` in TypeScript.

### add_llm_client / addLLMClient
A function to add an LLM client to the registry.

<ParamField
    path="name"
    type="string"
    required
>
    The name of the client.

    <Warning>
    Using the exact same name as a client also defined in .baml files overwrites the existing client whenever the ClientRegistry is used.
    </Warning>
</ParamField>

<ClientConstructorParams />

<ParamField path="retry_policy" type="string">
The name of a retry policy that is already defined in a .baml file. See [Retry Policies](/docs/snippets/clients/retry.mdx).
</ParamField>

### set_primary / setPrimary
This sets the client for the function to use. (i.e. replaces the `client` property in a function)

<ParamField
    path="name"
    type="string"
    required
>
    The name of the client to use.

    This can be a new client that was added with `add_llm_client` or an existing client that is already in a .baml file.
</ParamField>
