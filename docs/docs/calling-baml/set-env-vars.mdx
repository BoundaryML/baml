## Environment Variables in BAML

Environment variables are primarily used in clients to propagate authorization
credentials, such as API keys, like so:

```baml

client<llm> GPT4o {
  provider baml-openai-chat
  options {
    model gpt-4o
    api_key env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
}
```

## Setting Environment Variables in Python/Typescript/etc

The generated BAML client will capture all environment variables when you import it,
and will not be able to see any environment variables you load after importing
the BAML client.

Any of the following strategies are compatible with BAML:

  - set environment variables in your `Dockerfile`
  - set environment variables in your `next.config.js`
  - set environment variables in your Kubernetes manifest
  - load environment variables from secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
  - load environment variables from a secrets provider such as [Infisical](https://infisical.com/) / [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/)
  - dotenv (`.env` file) cli (e.g. `dotenv -e .env python myscript.py`)
  - using account credentials for ephemeral token generation (e.g. Vertex AI Auth Tokens)

## Modifying env variables in your program

<Info>
This is available in Baml Version 0.57+
</Info>

<CodeBlocks>

```python Python

from baml_client import b
from baml_client import reset_baml_env_vars
import os
import dotenv

dotenv.load_dotenv()
reset_baml_env_vars(dict(os.environ))
```

```typescript TypeScript
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
// Wait to import the BAML client until after loading environment variables
import { b, resetBamlEnvVars } from 'baml-client'

dotenv.config()
resetBamlEnvVars(process.env)
```

```ruby Ruby (beta)
require 'dotenv/load'

# Wait to import the BAML client until after loading environment variables
# reset_baml_env_vars is not yet implemented in the Ruby client
require 'baml_client'
```


</CodeBlocks>


We do not currently support any other mechanisms for providing authorization
credentials, including but not limited to:

  - fetching credentials from a secret storage service, such as AWS Secrets
    Manager or HashiCorp Vault

Please [contact us] if you need support for these use cases.
