title: "Set Environment Variables"
---

<Warning>
If you do anything to load environment variables in-process - e.g. using a
`.env` file - make sure to do it before importing the BAML client.
</Warning>

The generated BAML client will capture all environment variables when you import it,
and will not be able to see any environment variables you load after importing
the BAML client.

Any of the following strategies are compatible with BAML:

  - set environment variables in your `Dockerfile`
  - set environment variables in your `next.config.js`
  - set environment variables in your Kubernetes manifest
  - load environment variables from secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
  - load environment variables from a secrets provider such as Infisical


<Tip>If BAML doesn't work for your use case, please [contact us]!</Tip>

## Environment Variables in BAML

Environment variables are primarily used in clients to propagate authorization
credentials, such as API keys, like so:

```rust

client<llm> GPT4o {
  provider baml-openai-chat
  options {
    model gpt-4o
    api_key env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
}
```

We do not currently support any other mechanisms for providing authorization
credentials, including but not limited to:

  - exchanging refresh tokens for ephemeral authorization tokens
  - fetching credentials from a secret storage service, such as AWS Secrets
    Manager or HashiCorp Vault

Please [contact us] if you need support for these use cases.
