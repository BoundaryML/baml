**BAML is a domain-specific langauge to write and test LLM functions.**

In BAML, prompts are treated like functions. An LLM function is a prompt template with some defined input variables, and a specific output type like a class, enum, union, optional string, etc.


With BAML you can write and test a complex LLM function in 1/10 of the time it takes to setup a python LLM testing environment.

## Features

### Language features
- **Python / Typescript / Ruby support**: Plug-and-play BAML with other languages
- **JSON correction**: BAML fixes bad JSON returned by LLMs (e.g. unquoted keys, newlines, comments, extra quotes, and more)
- **Wide model support**: Ollama, Openai, Anthropic, Gemini. Tested on small models like Llama2
- **Streaming**: Stream structured partial outputs
- **Resilience and fallback features**: Add retries, redundancy, to your LLM calls

### Developer Experience
- **Stability**: BAML works the same in EVERY language we support. No more "it works in python but not in Typescript"
- **Type safety**: BAML is a typed language, so you get type errors before you run your LLM, and autocomplete in your IDE
- **Realtime Prompt Previews**: See the full prompt always, even if it has loops and conditionals
- **Testing support**: Test functions in the playground with 1 click

### Production features
- **Observability Platform**: Use Boundary Studio to visualize your functions and replay production requests with 1 click
