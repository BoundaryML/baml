Here's a sample repository: https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml-examples/tree/main/ruby-example

To set up BAML in ruby do the following:

<Steps>
  ### Install BAML VSCode Extension
      https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=boundary.BAML

      - syntax highlighting
      - testing playground
      - prompt previews

  
  ### Install baml
        ```bash
        bundle init
        bundle add baml sorbet-runtime sorbet-struct-comparable
        ```
  
  ### Add some starter code
      This will give you some starter BAML code in a `baml_src` directory.

      ```bash
      bundle exec baml-cli init
      ```

  
  ### Generate python code from .baml files

    This command will help you convert `.baml` files to `.rb` files. Everytime you modify your `.baml` files,
    you must re-run this command, and regenerate the `baml_client` folder.

    <Tip>
      If you download our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Boundary.baml-extension), it will automatically generate `baml_client` on save!
    </Tip>

    ```bash
    bundle exec baml-cli generate
    ```

  
  ### Use a baml function in Ruby!
    <Tip>If `baml_client` doesn't exist, make sure to run the previous step!</Tip>

    ```ruby main.rb
    require_relative "baml_client/client"

    def example(raw_resume)
        # r is an instance of Baml::Types::Resume, defined in baml_client/types
        r = Baml.Client.ExtractResume(resume: raw_resume)

        puts "ExtractResume response:"
        puts r.inspect
    end

    def example_stream(raw_resume)
        stream = Baml.Client.stream.ExtractResume(resume: raw_resume)

        stream.each do |msg|
            # msg is an instance of Baml::PartialTypes::Resume
            # defined in baml_client/partial_types
            puts msg.inspect
        end

        stream.get_final_response
    end

    example 'Grace Hopper created COBOL'
    example_stream 'Grace Hopper created COBOL'
    ```

  
</Steps>
