Here's a sample repository: 
https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml-examples/tree/main/python-fastapi-starter

To set up BAML in python do the following:

<Steps>
  ### Install BAML VSCode Extension
      https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=boundary.BAML

      - syntax highlighting
      - testing playground
      - prompt previews

      <Tip>
      In your VSCode User Settings, highly recommend adding this to get better autocomplete for python in general, not just BAML.

      ```json
      {
        "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic"
      }
      ```
      </Tip>
  
  ### Install baml
        ```bash
        pip install baml-py
        ```
  
  ### Add some starter code
      This will give you some starter BAML code in a `baml_src` directory.

      ```bash
      baml-cli init
      ```
  
  ### Generate python code from .baml files

    This command will help you convert `.baml` files to `.py` files. Everytime you modify your `.baml` files,
    you must re-run this command, and regenerate the `baml_client` folder.

    <Tip>
      If you download our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Boundary.baml-extension), it will automatically generate `baml_client` on save!
    </Tip>

    ```bash
    baml-cli generate
    ```
  
  ### Use a baml function in python!
    <Tip>If `baml_client` doesn't exist, make sure to run the previous step!</Tip>

    ```python main.py
    from baml_client import b
    from baml_client.types import Resume

    async def example(raw_resume: str) -> Resume: 
      # BAML's internal parser guarantees ExtractResume
      # to be always return a Resume type
      response = await b.ExtractResume(raw_resume)
      return response

    async def example_stream(raw_resume: str) -> Resume:
      stream = b.stream.ExtractResume(raw_resume)
      async for msg in stream:
        print(msg) # This will be a PartialResume type
      
      # This will be a Resume type
      final = stream.get_final_response()

      return final
    ```
  
</Steps>
