We currently don't have support for other editors, but we are working on it. If you have a favorite editor that you would like to see support for, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/boundaryml/baml/issues/new?title=Add%20<editor>%20Editor%20Support&body=Hi%21%20I%20use%20%3Ceditor%3E%20please%20add%20support.).

To get around this you can:

1. Use [Prompt Fiddle](https://www.promptfiddle.com) to write your code and then copy it to your editor.

2. Use the CLI. See [Generate the BAML Client](../../calling-baml/generate-baml-client.mdx)
