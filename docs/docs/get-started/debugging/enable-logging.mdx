You can add logging to determine what the BAML runtime is doing.

To enable logging, set the `BAML_LOG` environment variable:
```
BAML_LOG=info
```

BAML uses the rust `log` crate for logging. You can see more information on how to better configure the `log` crate [here](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/development_tools/debugging/config_log.html).

Just instead of using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable, use the `BAML_LOG` environment variable.
