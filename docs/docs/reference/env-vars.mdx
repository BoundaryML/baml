This is a full list of all environment variables that the BAML runtime respects.

`BAML_LOG`

- defaults to `warn` when used as a library, defaults to `info` in `baml-cli`
- sets the log level for BAML
- can be one of `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace` (note that `debug` and `trace` are reserved for internal use and are not stable)

`BAML_LOG_STYLE`

- `auto` (default) will attempt to print style characters, but don’t force the issue. If the console isn’t available on Windows, or if TERM=dumb, for example, then don’t print colors.
- `always` will always print style characters even if they aren’t supported by the terminal. This includes emitting ANSI colors on Windows if the console API is unavailable.
- `never` will never print style characters.

`BAML_PASSWORD`

Sets the password for `baml-cli serve`. See [Deploying BAML Projects / Docker (OpenAPI)](/docs/get-started/deploying/openapi) for more details.

- if unset, all incoming HTTP requests to `baml-cli serve` are authorized
- if set, all incoming HTTP requests must attach the password using either HTTP basic auth or the `X-BAML-API-KEY` header

`DANGER_ACCEPT_INVALID_CERTS`

- when `DANGER_ACCEPT_INVALID_CERTS=1`, turns off HTTPS cert validation
- only set this in development or testing environments

## Clients

<Note>
  You may also have your own environment variable references in clients, e.g. using
  `api_key env.MY_API_KEY` in a client definition.
