_Learn how to host your BAML functions on Boundary Cloud and call them over HTTP._

<Info>
  This feature was added in: v0.58.0.
</Info>

<Note>
  The BAML language, compiler, and runtime will always be 100% free and
  open-source: we will always allow you to run BAML functions directly in your
  own backends.
  
  Boundary Cloud's goal is to make it even easier to host and run BAML
  functions, by adding support for features like rate limits, telemetry, and
  end-user feedback.
</Note>

Boundary Cloud allows you to host your BAML functions on our infrastructure, and expose
one REST API endpoint per BAML function.

</div>

## Get Started

First, create your account and [choose a plan](https://boundaryml.com/pricing).

```bash
baml-cli login
```

Then, run this command in your `baml_src/` directory:

```bash
baml-cli deploy
```

which will point you to the dashboard, where you can set environment variables and create API keys.

<div class="flex flex-col items-center">
  <img class="rounded-md" src="/assets/images/docs_latest/deploy-screenshot.png" alt="Boundary Cloud deploy output" />
</div>

Once you've set the environment variables you need (probably `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
and/or `OPENAI_API_KEY`), you can call your BAML functions!

If you still have the `ExtractResume` function that your BAML project was created with,
you can use this command to test it out:

```bash
curl https://api2.boundaryml.com/v3/functions/prod/call/ExtractResume \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOUNDARY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- << EOF
{
  "resume": "

    - Associate Professor, Vassar College

    Skills:
    - COBOL
    - Compiler development

}
EOF
```

Congratulations! You've gotten your first BAML functions working on Boundary Cloud.

## Using your OpenAPI client

First, make sure you've updated your OpenAPI client to use `BOUNDARY_ENDPOINT` and `BOUNDARY_API_KEY` if set:

<Markdown src="../doc-snippets/openapi-howto-rely-on-envvars.mdx" />

<Info>
  Note to ourselves: dashboard.boundaryml.com/settings/api-keys
  will redirect to the API keys for the user's most recently viewed
  project, or if none exists, the first project that they're in.
</Info>

You can now visit the [Boundary Dashboard](https://dashboard.boundaryml.com/settings/api-keys/) to create an API key.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Production">

```bash
# no need to set BOUNDARY_ENDPOINT in prod
export BOUNDARY_API_KEY=...
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Development">
```bash
export BOUNDARY_ENDPOINT=https://api2.boundaryml.com/v3/functions/dev/
export BOUNDARY_API_KEY=...
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Info>
  DISCUSS: do we want server.url to point to https://api2.boundaryml.com/v3/functions/prod/ by default?

  There's also a feature called [server templating](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/api-host-and-base-path/) that I think we can use?

</Info>

You should now be able to call your deployed BAML functions using your OpenAPI client!

## Configuring environment variables

<Info>
  Note to ourselves: dashboard.boundaryml.com/settings/environment-variables
  will redirect to the project settings for the user's most recently viewed
  project, or if none exists, the first project that they're in.
</Info>

Environment variables are configured in the [Boundary Dashboard](https://dashboard.boundaryml.com/settings/environment-variables).

<Error>
  TODO: replace this with a screenshot of our UI.

  <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/docs_latest/boundary-cloud-secrets-ui.png" alt="Boundary Cloud secrets" />
  </div>
</Error>

You can set two types of environment variables per project:

  - production variables are only available in the `prod` deployment
  - development variables are used for all other deployments

<Info>
  Design question: is it important to have other "prod" environments? I think yes, but we can do something like
  `baml-cli deploy --preview --prod` to do a preview deployment with prod environment variables.
</Info>

## Deploying to different environments

Boundary Cloud deployments are classified as either "development" or "production".

Development deployments are the default; stdout is always the Deployment URL.

<Info>
  Design note: copying the vercel docs here: https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploying-from-cli

  Design note: URL format will be `api2.boundaryml.com/v3/functions/<project-name>-<git-branch-name>-<6 random alnum>/`

  alt: URL format will be `/v3/functions/<project-name>-<git-branch-name>-<6 random alnum>/`

  e.g. vercel uses "baml-git-gh-readonly-queue-canarypr-979-adbb6ae3883-a3eaef-gloo.vercel.app"
</Info>

```bash
baml-cli deploy
```

You can also deploy to a special development environment at `/v3/functions/dev/`:

```bash
baml-cli deploy --dev
```

To deploy to `prod`, and make your functions available at `/v3/functions/prod/`, run:

```bash
baml-cli deploy --prod
```
