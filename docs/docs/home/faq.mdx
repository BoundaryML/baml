 <Accordion title="How do I run BAML code">
You don't! BAML files get converted into Python or Typescript using the BAML CLI. You can run the generated code locally or in the cloud.
 </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the pricing?">
Contact us at contact@boundaryml.com for more details. We have a free tier available.

 <Accordion title="How do I run this locally? Does it add a new dependency?">
Nope. We do not proxy LLM calls for you. BAML just generates a bunch of python or TypeScript code you can run on your machine. If you opt-in to our logging and analytics we only send logs to our backend. Deploying your app is like deploying any other python/TS application.

  <Accordion title="Why make a new language?">
BAML isn't a full-fledged language -- it's more of a configuration file or templating language. You can load it into your code as if it were YAML.

We started this because we wanted [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/), but with types + function declarations, so we decided to make it happen. Earlier we tried making a YAML-based sdk, and even a Python SDK, but they were not powerful enough.

<Accordion title="Can I edit prompts using a no-code solution?">
  We are working on more tools like [PromptFiddle.com](https://promptfiddle.com) to make it easier to edit prompts for non-engineers, but we want to make sure all your prompts can be backed by a file in your codebase.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What languages are supported?">
  BAML can be generated into python and Typescript. The only feature not present in TypeScript is streaming. We are working on it! We are also working on Ruby.

  <Accordion title="How much does this cost?">
    The VSCode extension and BAML are free to use (Open Source as well!). We only charge for usage of
    BoundaryML Studio.
