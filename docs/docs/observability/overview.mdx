To enable observability with BAML, you'll first need to sign up for a [Boundary Studio](https://app.boundaryml.com) account. 

Once you've signed up, you'll be able to create a new project and get your project token.

Then simply add the following environment variables prior to running your application:

```bash
export BOUNDARY_PROJECT_ID=project_uuid
export BOUNDARY_SECRET=your_token
```
