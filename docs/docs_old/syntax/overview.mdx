title: BAML Project Structure
---

A BAML project has the following structure:

```bash
.
├── baml_client/ # Generated code
├── baml_src/ # Prompts live here
│   └── foo.baml
# The rest of your project (not generated nor used by BAML)
├── app/
│  ├── __init__.py
│  └── main.py
└── pyproject.toml

```

1. `baml_src/` is the directory where you write your BAML files with the AI
   function declarations, prompts, retry policies, etc. It also contains
   [generator](/syntax/generator) blocks which configure how and where to
   transpile your BAML code.

2. `baml_client/` is the directory where BAML will generate code, and where you'll
   import the generated code from.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from baml_client import baml as b

await b.YourAIFunction()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import b from "@/baml_client";

await b.YourAIFunction();
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  **You should never edit any files inside baml_client directory** as the whole
  directory gets regenerated on every `baml build` (auto runs on save if using
  the VSCode extension).
</Warning>

<Tip>
  If you ever run into any issues with the generated code (like merge
  conflicts), you can always delete the `baml_client` directory and it will get
  regenerated automatically once you fix any other conflicts in your `.baml`
  files.
</Tip>

### imports

BAML by default has global imports. Every entity declared in any `.baml` file
is available to all other `.baml` files under the same `baml_src` directory.
You **can** have multiple `baml_src` directories, but no promises on how the
VSCode extension will behave (yet).
