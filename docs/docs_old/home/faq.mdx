 <Accordion title="How do I run BAML code">
You don't! BAML files get converted into Python or Typescript using the BAML CLI. You can run the generated code locally or in the cloud.
 </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the pricing?">
Contact us at contact@boundaryml.com for more details. We have a free tier available.
 </Accordion>
 <Accordion title="How do I run this locally? Does it add a new dependency?">
Nope. We do not proxy LLM calls for you. BAML just generates a bunch of python or TypeScript code you can run on your machine. If you opt-in to our logging and analytics we only send logs to our backend. Deploying your app is like deploying any other python/TS application.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why make a new language?">
BAML isn't a full-fledged language -- it's more of a configuration file / templating language. You can load it into your code as if it were YAML. Think of it as an extension of [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) or Handlebars.

Earlier we tried making a YAML-based sdk, and even a Python SDK, but they were not powerful enough.

<Accordion title="Can I edit prompts using a no-code solution?">
  We are working on more tools like [PromptFiddle.com](https://promptfiddle.com) to make it easier to edit prompts for non-engineers, but we want to make sure all your prompts can be backed by a file in your codebase and versioned by Git.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What languages are supported?">
  Typescript, Python, and Ruby

  <Accordion title="How much does this cost?">
    The VSCode extension and BAML are free to use (Open Source as well!). We only charge for usage of
    Boundary Studio, our observability platform. Contact us for pricing. We do have a hobbyist tier and a startup tier available.
