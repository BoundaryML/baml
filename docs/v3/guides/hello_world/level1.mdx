### Pre-requisites

- Follow the [installation](/v3/home/installation) instructions to ensure you have a BAML environment set up.

<Warning>
  Before writing BAML, read the entirety of the Hello World example. This is
  important for understanding BAML project architectures
</Warning>

## Overview

Before you call an LLM, ask yourself what kind of input or output youre expecting. If you want the LLM to generate text, then you probably want a string, but if you're trying to get it to collect user details, you may want it to return a complex type like `UserDetails`.

Thinking this way can help you decompose large complex prompts into smaller, more measurable functions, and will also help you build more complex workflows and agents.

To get us started using BAML, we'll start with writing a simple AI function that extracts verbs from a sentence and start adding more and more complexity in later tutorials.

# Implementing an AI function

## 1. Define AI functions and models in BAML files

First we will define a function of the following signature in BAML:
`ExtractVerbs(input: string) -> string[]`

Here's the BAML equivalent:

```rust
/// Takes a title and body, and returns a list of verbs
function ExtractVerbs {
    input string
    /// list of verbs
    output string[]
}
```

Every BAML function has a strictly typed input and output. The input and output can be either a **primitive type** (string, number, boolean) or a [complex type](/v3/syntax/type) (think unions, lists, or even custom pydantic models)

To ensure the baml compiler generates your Python / TS code, you'll also need to add a `generator` block to your main.baml file:

```rust
generator {
  language python
    // poetry is the default if this doesn't exist
  pkg_manager pip
}
```

## 2. Implement the function using an LLM

To implement the function we need two things:

1. An LLM client that defines which LLM to call and with which params.
2. The actual prompt.

<Steps>
<Step title="Define the LLM client">
To implement a client we can just define one like this in a BAML file. Learn more about [clients](/v3/syntax/client) and non-openai chat providers.

If you used `baml init` you should already have a **clients.baml** file with this client:

```rust
client<llm> GPT4 {
  provider baml-openai-chat
  options {
    model gpt-4 
    api_key env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
}
```
<Tip>
Use any parameters available to that model, like temperature etc, by adding them to the options block. You can also use environment variables to store secrets like API keys.
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Define a prompt">
Next we can create the prompt by **implementing** the function using an LLM.
In BAML we provide helper utilities to inject the input variables into the prompt, and also get the LLM to return the right output type. You always get full-view of the whole prompt string, without any magic.

```rust
impl<llm, ExtractVerbs> version1 {
  client GPT4
  prompt #"
    Extract the verbs from this INPUT:
 
    INPUT:
    ---
    {#input}
    ---
    {// this is a comment inside a prompt! //}
    Return a {#print_type(output)}.

    Response:
  "#
}
```

In VSCode you can click on **"Open Playground"** on top of the impl or prompt to see the full prompt:

<img src="/images/v3/open_playground.png" />

<img src="/images/v3/extractverbs_playground.png" />

In here you'll notice how our language automatically dedents strings, injects variables into the prompt, and supports comments that will be stripped from the actual prompt. See our [syntax guide](/v3/syntax/strings) for more information on basic string / comment syntax.

We will explain more how **print_type** works in later tutorials.

</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Use the function in your Python / TS code

Our VSCode extension automatically generates a python **baml_client** to access and call your functions.

```python main.py
from baml_client import baml as b
import asyncio

async def main():
  verb_list = await b.ExtractVerbs(
    "This is a paragraph"
  )

  if len(verb_list) == 1:
      print("There is 1 verb in this paragraph")
  else:
      print(f"There are {len(verb_list)} verb(s) in this paragraph")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())
```

<Accordion title="What are these awaits or async things?">
  The BAML client exports async versions of your functions, so you can parallelize things easily if you need to. To run async functions sequentially you can easily just wrap them in the `asyncio.run(....)`. 
  
  Let us know if you want synchronous versions of your functions instead!
