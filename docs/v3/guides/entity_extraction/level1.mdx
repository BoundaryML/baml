title: "1: Extracting entities from emails"
description: Basic entity extraction
---

## Use cases
What types of problems are entity extraction problems?
- Filling out a form with a chat bot
- Getting specific details out of long form text
- Calling a function in your code with some parameters after analyzing some text (like OpenAI Functions)

## Pre-requisites
* **Ensure you have read the first guide: [Level 1: Writing AI functions](/v3/guides/hello_world/overview)**.


# Extracting order details from text
In this tutorial we'll write an AI function that can take an Order status email and extract order information from it.

Our function signature will be:
`GetOrderInfo(email: Email) -> OrderInfo`

Here is the [reference code](https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml-examples/tree/main/extraction-guide) for these sets of tutorials. Clone the repo and install BAML extension to get syntax highlighting!

## 1. Define AI functions and models in BAML files
First create the data models using [classes](/v3/syntax/class), which actually get converted to actual pydantic models at generation time if using Python.
```rust baml_src/main.baml
class Email {
  subject string
  body string
}

class OrderInfo {
  id string
  date string
  product_name string
  cost float
}
```

The code snippet you provided is declaring the AI function signature for a function called `GetOrderInfo`. This function takes an input of type `Email` and outputs an `OrderInfo`. By defining this function signature in your BAML file, you are essentially setting up the structure for how the AI function will operate and what kind of data it will expect as input and output.
Then declare the AI function signature
```rust baml_src/main.baml
function GetOrderInfo {
  input Email
  output OrderInfo
}
```
Hit Ctrl + S in VSCode, and you should get a generated baml_client to import in your python code (more on this later).

## 2. Implement the function using an LLM

<Steps>
<Step title="Define the LLM client">
Refer to [Level 1: Writing AI functions](/v3/guides/hello_world/overview)
</Step>
<Step title="Define a prompt">
Create the prompt by **implementing** the function using an LLM.


```rust
impl<llm, GetOrderInfo> version1 {
  client GPT4
  prompt #"
    Given the email below:

    Email Subject: {#input.subject}
    Email Body: {#input.body}

    Extract this info from the email in JSON format:
    {
      "id": string,
      "date": string,
      "product_name": string,
      "cost": float
    }

    JSON:
  "#
}
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Simplify the prompt using print_type utility
Rather than writing out the JSON format we want manually, lets automate that process so that if we add, remove or change fields the prompt is automatically updated.

BAML provides a utility called `print_type` that will print out the JSON format of a type. We'll use this to print out the desired OrderInfo type.

```rust
...
  prompt #"
    Given the email below:

    Email Subject: {#input.subject}
    Email Body: {#input.body}

    Extract this info from the email in JSON format:
    {#print_type(output)}

    JSON:
  "#
```
<Note>In BAML we provide helper utilities to inject the input variables into the prompt, and also get the LLM to return the right output type. You always get full-view of the whole prompt string, without any magic.</Note>

In the BAML VSCode Playground you should see the rendered prompt:

```text
Given the email below:

Email Subject: {arg.subject}
Email Body: {arg.body}

Extract this info from the email in JSON format:
{
  "id": string,
  "date": string,
  "product_name": string,
  "cost": float
}

JSON:
```

## 3. Call the function in Python / TS

Our VSCode extension automatically generates a python **baml_client** to access and call your functions. All fully type-safe. Verify that if you add the wrong input you do see an error.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from baml_client import baml as b
# Import your generated Email model. 
# We generate this pydantic model for you.
from baml_client.baml_types import Email
import asyncio

async def main():
  order_info = await b.GetOrderInfo(Email(
      subject="Order #1234",
      body="Your order has been shipped. It will arrive on 1st Jan 2022. Product: iPhone 13. Cost: $999.99"
  ))

  # This is all fully typed for you:
  if order_info.cost > 1000:
      print("You spent a lot of money!")
  elif order_info.cost > 500:
      print("You spent a chunk of money!")
  else:
      print("You spent a little money!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import b from '@/baml_client'
import { Email } from '@/baml_client/baml_types'

const main = async () => {
  const order_info = await b.GetOrderInfo({
      subject="Order #1234",
      body="Your order has been shipped. It will arrive on 1st Jan 2022. Product: iPhone 13. Cost: $999.99"
  });

  if (order_info.cost > 1000) {
    console.log("You spent a lot of money!")
  } else if (order_info.cost > 500) {
    console.log("You spent a chunk of money!")
  } else {
    console.log("You spent a little money!")
  }
};

if (require.main === module) {
  main();
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Note that you may get some errors testing other cases. We'll discuss how to make this more resilient in the next tutorial.
