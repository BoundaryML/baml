description: "Learn how to use @alias, @description, and optional types"

Let's improve the existing example in [level 1](./level1) to get better results.

You may have noticed our current prompt is kind of vague:

```
...
Extract this info from the email in JSON format:
{
  "id": string,
  "date": string,
  "product_name": string,
  "cost": float
}

JSON:
```

What ID are we looking for here? The Order id? The user id? The prompt doesn't say so the LLM end up choosing the wrong value.

We could change our `OrderInfo.id` class property to `OrderInfo.order_id`, but renaming the property may not be what we want. What if we store this data in a database? The DB schema will not like the name change...

The same goes for the date -- we may want to get a specific timestamp format like ISO8601, but we dont want to rename our property to `OrderInfo.date_iso8601`...

To solve this we will add @aliases and @descriptions to rename the properties and make it more understandable to the LLM, without having to change our python code.

## Prerequisites

- Level 1 of this tutorial

## Adding aliases and descriptions

Lets add more info to our models first:

```rust
// Stays the same, since it's an input to the function. No need to describe these fields.
class Email {
  subject string
  body string
}

// This is the function's output, so we want to add descriptions
class OrderInfo {
  id string
  @alias("order_id")
  @description("The id of the order")
  date string
  @description("The date the order was placed in ISO8601 format")
  product_name string
  @description("The name of the first product listed")
  cost float
  @description("The cost, in dollars, without currency symbols")
}
```

Now that descriptions are more verbose and clear, our prompt will still look like this -- no changes were needed:

```rust
...
  prompt #"
    Given the email below:

    Email Subject: {#input.subject}
    Email Body: {#input.body}

    Extract this info from the email in JSON format:
    {#print_type(output)}

    JSON:
  "#
```

**print_type(output)** will do the heavy lifting and render JSON with the right descriptions for you. This is what you'll see in our VSCode Playground.

```text
Given the email below:

Email Subject: {arg.subject}
Email Body: {arg.body}

Extract this info from the email in JSON format:
{
  // The id of the order
  "order_id": string,
  // The date the order was placed in ISO8601 format
  "date": string,
  // The name of the first product listed
  "product_name": string,
  // The cost, in dollars, without currency symbols
  "cost": float
}
JSON:
```
<Note>
This is similar to the format OpenAI uses to render schemas, with the description as "// Description" on top of each field.
</Note>

The [BAML deserializer](/v3/syntax/prompt_engineering/type-deserializer) is smart enough to map each field in your object back to the original property name, so you can still use `order_info.id` in your python code.

## Using Optionals

Some emails may not have all available information. To get around this we can easily modify OrderInfo to use [optionals](/v3/syntax/type#optional). The @alias and @descriptions have been removed for brevity:

```rust
class OrderInfo {
  id string?
  date string?
  product_name string?
  cost float?
}
```

After the optionals are added, **print_type(output)** will now append `| null` to the type:

```
...
{
  // The id of the order
  "order_id": string | null,
  ...
}

```

## Calling your function

Now that `cost` might be null, we need to handle that:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from baml_client import baml as b
from baml_client.baml_types import Email
import asyncio

async def main():
  order_info = await b.GetOrderInfo(Email(
      subject="Order #1234",
      body="Your order has been shipped. It will arrive on 1st Jan 2022. Product: iPhone 13. Cost: $999.99"
  ))

  if order_info.cost is None:
      print("No cost found")
  elif order_info.cost > 1000:
      print("You spent a lot of money!")
  elif order_info.cost > 500:
      print("You spent a chunk of money!")
  else:
      print("You spent a little money!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import b from '@/baml_client'
import { Email } from '@/baml_client/baml_types'

const main = async () => {
  const order_info = await b.GetOrderInfo({
      subject="Order #1234",
      body="Your order has been shipped. It will arrive on 1st Jan 2022. Product: iPhone 13. Cost: $999.99"
  });

  if (order_info.cost === null) {
    console.log("No cost found")
  if (order_info.cost > 1000) {
    console.log("You spent a lot of money!")
  } else if (order_info.cost > 500) {
    console.log("You spent a chunk of money!")
  } else {
    console.log("You spent a little money!")
  }
};

if (require.main === module) {
  main();
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we learned:

1. How to use [@alias and
    @description](/v3/syntax/prompt_engineering/class#property-attributes) to modify
    what `print_type` renders
1. How to use [optionals](/v3/syntax/type#optional) to handle missing data

We recommend learning more about how to dynamically serialize the input using
[computed properties](/v3/syntax/class#computed-properties). Specifically for
serializing a string[] into a prompt.

Want more resiliency? Take a look at adding [**retry
policies**](/v3/syntax/client/retry) and fallbacks to your BAML LLM Client.

## Next steps

In the next tutorials we will learn how to use more complex types like enums, lists, unions.
