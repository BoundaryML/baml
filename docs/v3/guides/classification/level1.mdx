description: Using enums to write a classifier
---

## Use cases

What types of problems are classification problems?

- Deciding which tools an AI agent should use
- Sentiment analysis
- Labeling emails
- Spam detection
- Customer Intent detection

In this tutorial we'll write a classifier that can figure out what a customer's intent is when they send us a message. We'll use the following labels:

- `refund`
- `cancel-order`
- `technical-support`
- `account-issue`
- `question`

## Pre-requisites

**Ensure you have read the first guide: [Level 1: Writing AI functions](/v3/guides/hello_world/level1)**.
We will re-use the same `client` we declared there.

## 1. Define AI functions and models in BAML files

To solve this problem using LLMs we want a function of this signature:
`ClassifyIntent(string) -> Intent`

To do this we can use an `enum` to represent all the labels we want to classify.

```rust classifier.baml
enum Intent {
    Refund
    CancelOrder
    TechnicalSupport
    AccountIssue
    Question
}
```

Then declare a BAML function signature:

```rust classifier.baml
function ClassifyIntent {
  input string
  output Intent
}
```
This is more like an interface than an actual function. See next step for how to implement it.

## 2. Implement the function using an LLM

<Steps>
<Step title="Define the LLM client">
Refer to [Level 1: Writing AI functions](/v3/guides/hello_world/overview)
</Step>
<Step title="Define a prompt">
Create the prompt by **implementing** the function using an LLM.
In BAML we provide helper utilities to inject the input variables into the prompt, and also get the LLM to return the right output type. You always get full-view of the whole prompt string, without any magic.

```rust
impl<llm, ClassifyIntent> version1 {
  client GPT4
  prompt #"
    Classify the following INPUT into ONE
    of the following Intents:

    - Refund
    - CancelOrder
    - TechnicalSupport
    - AccountIssue
    - Question

    INPUT: {#input}

    Response:
  "#
}
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### 2.1 Simplify the prompt using the print_enum utility

Rather than writing out the enums painstakingly into the prompt manually, lets automate that process so that if we change the enum names or values the prompt gets updated automatically.

BAML provides a utility function called [print_enum(..)](/v3/syntax/prompt_engineering/variables#printers) that will print an enum's values into your prompt in a neatly formatted way that LLMs should understand.

Here is the updated `impl`:

```rust
impl<llm, ClassifyIntent> version1 {
  client GPT4
  prompt #"
    Classify the following INPUT into ONE
    of the following Intents:

    {#print_enum(Intent)}

    INPUT: {#input}

    Response:
  "#
}
```

Our VSCode playground shows you what `print_enum(..)` does to the prompt at compile time. Here is what the playground will show:

```text
Classify the following INPUT into ONE
of the following Intents:

Intent
---
Refund
CancelOrder
TechnicalSupport
AccountIssue
Question

INPUT: {arg}

Response:
```

You can see it adds the enum name "Intent", and then the list of enums below.

If you need to change the formatting, contact us to learn more about your usecase.

<Tip>
  When using `print_enum` it automatically handles scenarios where you add new
  enum values, or change the enum name. No need to edit both the prompt and the
  enum definition.
</Tip>

## 3. Use the function in your Python / TS code

Our VSCode extension automatically generates a python **baml_client** to access and call your functions.

```python
from baml_client import baml as b
# Import your generated python enum
from baml_client.baml_types import Intent


customer_intent = await b.ClassifyIntent("I want to cancel my order")
if customer_intent == Intent.CancelOrder:
    print("Customer wants to cancel order")
else:
    print("Customer wants to {}".format(customer_intent))
```

## 4. [Recommended] Write unit tests

As you keep working with BAML, we recommend [setting up a test suite](/v3/home/running-tests) or using our [tracing capabilities](/v3/home/tracing-tagging) to make it easier to dive into issues (and get some nice analytics in Boundary Studio).

## Conclusion
In this tutorial we've learned:
1. How to use [enums](/v3/syntax/enum) to represent a classification problem
2. BAML utility function --  [print_enum(..)](/v3/syntax/prompt_engineering/enum) -- to automatically print the enum values into the prompt

## Next Steps

In the next section you'll learn how to use @alias and @description to dynamically change the name of the enums, while keeping your python code intact.
