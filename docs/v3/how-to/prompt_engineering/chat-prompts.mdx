<Warning>
    You are currently viewing the old BAML documentation. This syntax is still supported, but will eventually be deprecated in newer versions of BAML.
</Warning>

When using certain models, you may wish to add a role to a section of a message.

This can be done by adding a `{#chat(role)}` block into the prompt.

For example:

```rust example.baml
// example.baml
class Resume {
  name string
  skills string[]
}

function ExtractResume {
  input (resume_text: string)
  output Resume[]
}

impl<llm, ExtractResume> version1 {
  client GPT4Client // client definition not shown
  prompt #"
    {#chat(system)}
    Parse the following resume and return a structured representation of the data in the schema below.

    {#chat(user)}
    Resume:
    ---
    {#input.resume_text}
    ---
    Output in this JSON format:
    {#print_type(output)}

    Output JSON:
  "#
}
```
