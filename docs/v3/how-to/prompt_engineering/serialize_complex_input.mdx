    You are currently viewing the old BAML documentation. This syntax is still supported, but will eventually be deprecated in newer versions of BAML.

Use [computed properties](/v3/syntax/class#computed-properties) to add custom rendering logic.

### Example 1 - Rendering a date in a nicer format

This function takes an invoice and gives a 1 sentence summary of what it's for.

We will insert the invoice details into the prompt, but will modify add a [computed property](/v3/syntax/class#computed-properties) to render the date in a more human-friendly format.

```rust
class Invoice {
  id string?
  amount float
  // originally in ISO8601 format (2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z)
  date string
  // The computed property
  displayDate string @get(python#"
    from datetime import datetime
    return datetime.fromisoformat(self.date).strftime('%B %d, %Y')
  "#)
  from string
  to string
}

function SummarizeInvoice {
  input Invoice
  output string
}

impl<llm, SummarizeInvoice> v1 {
  client GPT4 // See tutorial on how to define this
  prompt #"
    Summarize the invoice information into a single sentence.

    ### InvoiceDetails:
    id: {#input.id}
    amount: {#input.amount}
    date: {#input.displayDate}
    from: {#input.from}
    to: {#input.to}
    ###

    Summary:
  "#
}

```
You can add any computed property you want to a **class**. In this case, we added a `displayDate` property that is computed from the `date` property. But you can execute any python code you want in the `@get` decorator.
