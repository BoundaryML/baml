### Common pytest issues
<Warning>
  Make sure your test file, the Test class AND/or the test function is prefixed with `Test` or `test` respectively. Otherwise, pytest will not pick up your tests. E.g. `test_foo.py`, `TestFoo`, `test_foo`
</Warning>

<Warning>
  Make sure you are running these commands from your python virtual environment
  (or **`poetry shell`** if you use poetry).
</Warning>

<Warning>
**No module named `baml_lib`**. <p/>
Try running `poetry run python -m pytest -m baml_test` instead if you are using poetry. Double check you are in a poetry shell and that there is a `baml_client` and `baml` dependency in your project
</Warning>
### Helpful Pytest commands


```bash
# From your project root
# Lists all tests with the baml_test marker
pytest -m baml_test --collect-only
```

```bash
# From your project root
# Runs all tests
# For every function, for every impl
pytest -m baml_test
```

To run tests for a subdirectory

```bash
# From your project root
# Note the underscore at the end of the folder name
pytest -m baml_test ./your-tests-folder/
```

To run tests that match a specific name
E.g. if  your test is called "test_thing_123", the following command will run this test:

```bash
# From your project root
pytest -m baml_test -k thing
```

You can read more about the `-k` arg of pytest here ([PyTest Docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/markers.html#using-k-expr-to-select-tests-based-on-their-name))

`-k` will match any tests with that given name.

To run a specific test case in a test group

```bash
# From your project root
pytest -m baml_test -k 'test_group_name and test_case_name'
```

### Testing multiple impls using fixtures (advanced)
We automatically export a pytest fixture for each of your defined functions that will automatically convert a test function into N test functions, where N is the number of impls you have defined for that function.

Instead of writing:
```python
@baml_test
async def test_impl1_foo():
  assert b.Foo.get_impl("v1").run(...)

@baml_test
async def test_impl2_foo():
  assert b.Foo.get_impl("v2").run(...)
```

You can import the fixture in:

```python Test Function
# Import your baml-generated functions
from baml_client import baml as b
# Import any custom types defined in .baml files
from baml_client.baml_types import Sentiment, IClassifySentiment

# This automatically generates a test case for each impl
# of ClassifySentiment.
@b.ClassifySentiment.test
async def test_happy_user(ClassifySentimentImpl: IClassifySentiment):
    # Note that the parameter name "ClassifySentimentImpl"
    # must match the name of the function you're testing
    response = await ClassifySentimentImpl("I am ecstatic")
    assert response == Sentiment.POSITIVE
```

### Grouping tests
You can also group tests in test classes. We won't use the impl-specific fixture in this case for simplicity.
The dashboard will show you grouped tests as well if you use this method, which can be handy for organizing your tests.


```python
@baml_test
class TestClassifySentiment:
    async def test_happy_user(self):
        response = await b.ClassifySentiment("I am ecstatic")
        assert response == Sentiment.POSITIVE

    async def test_sad_user(self):
        response = await b.ClassifySentiment("I am sad")
        assert response == Sentiment.NEGATIVE
```

<Tip> 
The class name must start with "Test" or it won't get picked up by Pytest.
</Tip>

## Parameterization
You can also parameterize your tests. This is useful if you want to test a function with a variety of inputs.

The parameters to the parametrize annotation indicate the name of the arguments sent into the test.

```python
...
import pytest

@baml_test
class TestClassifySentiment:
    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "input, expected",
        [
            ("I am ecstatic", Sentiment.POSITIVE),
            ("I am sad", Sentiment.NEGATIVE),
        ],
    )
    # Note the name of the args matches what we defined in the parametrize annotation. The first arg is "self" since this is inside a class.
    async def test_sentiment(self, input, expected):
        response = await b.ClassifySentiment(input)
        assert response == expected
```
Or alternatively, you can group things by sentiment. You dont need to use a class.

```python
import pytest
from baml_client.testing import baml_test
from baml_client import baml as b
from baml_client.baml_types import Sentiment

@baml_test
@pytest.mark.asyncio
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "input",
    [
        "I am ecstatic",
        "I am super happy!",
        "I am thrilled",
        "I am overjoyed",
    ],
)
async def test_happy_sentiments(input):
    response = await b.ClassifySentiment(input)
    assert response == Sentiment.POSITIVE

@baml_test
@pytest.mark.asyncio
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "input",
    [
        "I am sad",
        "I am angry",
        "I am upset",
        "I am frustrated",
    ],
)
async def test_sad_sentiments(input):
    response = await b.ClassifySentiment(input)
    assert response == Sentiment.NEGATIVE
```
