title: "Tracing and tagging functions"
---

BAML allows you to trace any function with the **@trace** decorator.
This will make the function's input and output show up in the Boundary dashboard. This works for any python function you define yourself. BAML LLM functions (or any other function declared in a .baml file) are already traced by default. Logs are only sent to the Dashboard if you setup your environment variables correctly.


### Prerequisites
Make sure you setup the [Boundary dashboard](/quickstart#setting-up-the-boundary-dashboard) project before you start.

Make sure you also CTRl+S a .baml file to generate the `baml_client`

### Example

In the example below, we trace each of the two functions `pre_process_text` and `full_analysis`:

```python
import pytest
from baml_client.testing import baml_test
from baml_client import baml
from baml_client.baml_types import Book, AuthorInfo
from baml_client.tracing import trace

# You can also add a custom name with trace(name="my_custom_name")
# By default, we use the function's name.
@trace
async def pre_process_text(text):
    return text.replace("\n", " ")


@trace
async def full_analysis(book: Book):
    sentiment = await baml.ClassifySentiment.get_impl("v1").run(
        pre_process_text(book.content)
    )
    book_analysis = await baml.AnalyzeBook.get_impl("v1").run(book)
    return book_analysis


@baml_test
class TestBookAnalysis:
    async def test_book1(self):
        content = """Before I could reply that he [Gatsby] was my neighbor...
        """
        processed_content = await pre_process_text(content)
        return await full_analysis(
            Book(
                title="The Great Gatsby",
                author=AuthorInfo(firstName="F. Scott", lastName="Fitzgerald"),
                content=processed_content,
            ),
        )
```


This allows us to see each function invocation, as well as all its children in the dashboard:

See [running tests](/running-tests) for more information on how to run this test.

### Adding custom tags

The dashboard view allows you to see custom tags for each of the function calls. This is useful for adding metadata to your traces and allow you to query your generated logs more easily.

To add a custom tag, you can import **update_trace_tags(..)** as below:

```python
from baml_client.tracing import set_tags, trace
import typing

@trace()
async def pre_process_text(text):
    set_tags(userId="1234")

    # You can also create a dictionary and pass it in
    tags_dict: typing.Dict[str, str] = {"userId": "1234"}
    set_tags(**tags_dict) # "**" unpacks the dictionary
    return text.replace("\n", " ")
```
