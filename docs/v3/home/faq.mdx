 <Accordion title="How do I run this locally? Does it add a new dependency?">
Nope. We do not proxy LLM calls for you. BAML just generates a bunch of python or TypeScript code you can run on your machine. If you opt-in to our logging and analytics we only send logs to our backend. Deploying your app is like deploying any other python/TS application.

  <Accordion title="Why make a new language?">
We're slightly masochistic and we wanted to implement an [ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half ofÂ Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule#:~:text=Greenspun's%20tenth%20rule%20of%20programming,of%20half%20of%20Common%20Lisp.).

But in all seriousness, we were inspired by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and JSX, and we love working with strongly typed languages. Building our own compiler has allowed us to implement features no other python or typescript library can, like the VSCode playground.

<Accordion title="Can I edit prompts using a no-code solution?">
  No, we believe the most resilient and/or complex AI pipelines are those that can be written and tested with your codebase.

  We promise that once you setup VSCode it is trivially easy to edit your prompts. It's as easy as editing YAML or JSON.

  <Accordion title="How much does this cost?">
    The VSCode extension and BAML are free to use (Opensource as well!). We only charge for usage of
    BoundaryML Studio.
