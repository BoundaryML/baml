We're slightly masochistic and we wanted to implement an [ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half ofÂ Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule#:~:text=Greenspun's%20tenth%20rule%20of%20programming,of%20half%20of%20Common%20Lisp.).

But in all seriousness, we were inspired by Prisma and JSX, and also being C++ and Java programmers for almost 10 years each, we hate untyped/weakly-typed systems. ðŸ™‚
