### Language Support

Because we have our own language and our compiler generates native Python/TS code from BAML files, we are able to treat both languages as first class citizens in the ecosystem. 

| Language Support | Status | Notes                               |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Python           | âœ…     |                                     |
| TypeScript       | ðŸš§     | Pending Retry and Streaming Support |

Contact us on Discord if you have a language you'd like to see supported.
