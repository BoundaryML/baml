We've built Boundary Studio to render your AI workflows in an easy to understand manner. We help you:

- See all the steps of your AI Pipeline (cost, latency, accuracy, etc.)
- Label data and leave comments for your AI engineers
- Search/group logs by custom attributes (e.g. customer ID, timestamp, etc.)
- and more

<div className="flex flex-row text-sm gap-2">
  <div className="flex flex-col p-2">
    <img src="/images/v3/boundary_studio_pipeline.png" />
    <span>
      Get high-level overviews of your AI pipelines and what AI functions are
      used and how often
    </span>
  </div>

          <div className="flex flex-col">

        <img src="/images/v3/boundary_studio_timeline.png" />

    <span>Or, dig deep into a specific request and see what happened in the pipeline leading to the issue</span>

</div>
</div>

The same typing system (see AI Engineer and Full Stack Dev) that makes life easier for your devs allows Boundary Studio to render outputs of each step of your pipeline in a readable manner. **Our toolchain can run without sending any of your sensitive data to Boundary's servers.**

Leave feedback (quality ratings or comments) that can then be ingested by your AI engineers via their favorite tool: Pandas Dataframes.
