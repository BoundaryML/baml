## From BAML Studio

<Info>Coming soon</Info>
You can also create tests from production logs in BAML Studio. Any weird or atypical
user inputs can be used to create a test case with just 1 click.

## Programmatically

Tests can also be defined using common testing frameworks like pytest. [Learn more](/v3/syntax/function-testing).
