BAML **enforces a contract** between business logic code and AI models (LLMs and more). Every AI function defined in BAML configuration has a defined input and output type instead of just strings.

`.baml` files contain function interfaces + prompts that compile into a generated, type-safe Python client, that makes building an AI app like putting lego blocks together. Just call `baml.YourAIFunction(...)`.

While composing AI functions may reduce generality, it increases reliability
and security. **Separation of responsibilities allows teams to more
efficiently work in parallel.**

  With BAML, you can easily convert a flowchart into **clean, readable code** like
  this, so your AI functions look just like regular functions.

**Some other benefits include:**

- Configure retry/redundancy/caching policies in `.baml` files so your business logic code stays readable/unchanged. [Learn how]
- **Everything lives in your codebase, backed by git!**
- The generated client comes with built-in tracing for every AI function, providing observability in Boundary Studio. Add custom tags (e.g. userId, convoId, or anything else) programmatically for more powerful searching / debugging. [Learn how]
- If a function contract changes in BAML, get a syntax error in your application code. Retry/Redundancy/Model/Prompt/etc changes never cause you to change application code
