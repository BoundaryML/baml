  <Step title="Install BAML VSCode Extension">
    [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gloo.BAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gloo.BAML)

    If you are using python, [enable typechecking in VSCode's](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference#_python-language-server-settings) `settings.json`:
    ```
    "python.analysis.typecheckingMode": "basic"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install BAML compiler">
<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
brew install boundaryml/baml/baml
```

```bash Linux (debian)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoundaryML/homebrew-baml/main/install-baml.sh | bash
```

```bash Windows / WSL (via scoop)
# You can install scoop at https://scoop.sh/
scoop bucket add baml-bucket https://github.com/boundaryml/homebrew-baml
scoop install baml
```

</CodeGroup>
You should be able to run `baml --version` and see the version number. The VSCode Extension will keep the compiler up to date for you.

  If you don't have brew, see: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/). If you
  don't have scoop, see: [https://scoop.sh/](https://scoop.sh/).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add BAML to a project">
    In your python project, run 
    ```baml init```.
    
    <Tip>
    After running `baml init`, add or modify baml files in the `./baml_src` directory
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the python dependency">
    The BAML CLI will install a python package called `baml` into your project (not to be confused with the baml CLI of the same name).

    Run `baml update-client` to make sure the python package is installed and on the latest version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up Boundary Studio (optional)">
    Create an account at [https://app.boundaryml.com](https://app.boundaryml.com).
    
    Set up a project and generate a secret.

    In your `.env` file, set the following values generated from the web app:
    ```bash
    BOUNDARY_PROJECT_ID=proj_...
    BOUNDARY_SECRET=gloo:...
    ```
