```

```bash Linux (debian)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BamlHQ/homebrew-baml/main/install-baml.sh | bash

    # Assuming my_project is an existing python project managed by poetry
    cd /path/to/my_project

    # Add BAML to the project (similar to git init)
    baml init

    # copy .env.example to .env and fill in the values
    # cp .env.example .env

    # Run the demo.
    poetry run python -m py_baml_example

    # All the baml files are available in the ./baml_src directory
