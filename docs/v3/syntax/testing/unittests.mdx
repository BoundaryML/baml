There are two types of tests you may want to run on your AI functions:

- Unit Tests: Tests a single AI function
- Integration Tests: Tests a pipeline of AI functions and potentially buisness logic

We support both types of tests using BAML. This reference guide will show you how to write tests for your AI functions, see [Integration tests](/v3/syntax/testing/integrationtests) for more information on how to write tests for your business logic.

## Using the playground (recommended)

Use the playground to run tests against individual function impls. The playground allows a type-safe interface for creating tests along with running them.
Under the hood, the playground runs `baml test` for you and writes the test files to the `__tests__` folder (see below).

## Running tests with BAML CLI

You can also use the BAML CLI to run tests. This is useful if you want to run tests in a CI/CD pipeline.

```bash
# List all tests
$ baml test
================= 12/12 tests selected (0 deselected) =================
ClassifyDocumentTopic (impls: simpleclassifydocumenttopic) (1 tests)
  combined_aquamarine ○
ClassifyIntent (impls: advanced, simple) (6 tests)
  amazing_copper ○ ○
  probable_teal ○ ○
  witty_amethyst ○ ○
ExtractInvoice (impls: foo) (1 tests)
  quixotic_peach ○
ExtractMeetingRequestInfo (impls: robust, simple) (2 tests)
  noisy_crimson ○ ○
GetDetailsKyle (impls: v1) (1 tests)
  christian_purple ○
GetNextQuestion (impls: v1) (1 tests)
  beneficial_moccasin ○
================= 12/12 tests selected (0 deselected) =================

# Run all tests
$ baml test run

# Run tests for a specific function
$ baml test -i "MyFunction:" run

# Run tests for a specific function impl
$ baml test -i "MyFunction:simple" run

# Run a specific test case.
$ baml test -i "::smoky_monkey" run

# Run all tests except for a specific test case.
$ baml test -x "::smoky_monkey" run

# Help
$ baml test --help
```

<Tip>
  You can always run w/o the `run` command to see what tests will be run.

## From BAML Studio

<Info>Coming soon</Info>
You can also create tests from production logs in BAML Studio. Any weird or atypical
user inputs can be used to create a test case with just 1 click.

## Creating tests manually

Unit tests created by the playground are stored in the `__tests__` folder.

The project structure should look like this:

```bash
.
├── baml_client/
└── baml_src/
    ├── __tests__/
    │   ├── YourAIFunction/
    │   │   ├── test_name_monkey.json
    │   │   └── test_name_cricket.json
    │   └── YourAIFunction2/
    │       └── test_name_jellyfish.json
    ├── main.baml
    └── foo.baml
```

You can manually create tests by creating a folder for each function you want to test. Inside each folder, create a json file for each test case you want to run. The json file should be named `test_name.json` where `test_name` is the name of the test case.

To see the structure of the JSON file, you can create a test using the playground and then copy the JSON file into your project.

<Tip>
  The BAML compiler reads the `__tests__` folder and generates a pytest file for
  you so you don't have to manually write test boilerplate code.
