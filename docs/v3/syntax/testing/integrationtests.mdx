title: Integration Testing
---

An integration test allows you to test a pipeline calling multiple functions. You may do things like, set up a mock database, mocking an AI function, calling a real AI function, etc.

## Prerequisites

Read [Tests with evaluators](/v3/syntax/testing/evaluators) first to grast our pytest plugin.

## Writing an Integration Tests

You can write an integration test normally using pytest. However, you can also use the `baml_test` decorator to record your test on the dashboard and do some setup for you.

```python pipeline.py
from baml_client import baml as b

async def pipeline(message: str) -> str:
    response = await b.ClassifySentiment(message)
    if response == Sentiment.POSITIVE:
        return await b.GetHappyResponse(message)
    else:
        return await b.GetSadResponse(message)
```

```python test_pipeline.py
# import baml test decorator
from baml_client.testing import baml_test

from pipeline import pipeline

@baml_test
async def test_pipeline():
    message = "I am ecstatic"
    response = await pipeline(message)
    assert response == "I am happy"
```

## Using Mocks

For that same test, we can mock the `ClassifySentiment` function to return a negative sentiment. This allows us to test the `GetSadResponse` function and also not have to worry about the AI function returning a different result each time.

```python test_pipeline.py
# import baml test decorator
from baml_client.testing import baml_test

from pipeline import pipeline

@baml_test
async def test_pipeline():
    message = "I am ecstatic"
    # Indicate we are mocking the ClassifySentiment function
    with b.ClassifySentiment.mock() as classify_sentiment_mock:
        # Set the return value of the mock
        classify_sentiment_mock.return_value = Sentiment.NEGATIVE
        response = await pipeline(message)

        classify_sentiment_mock.assert_called()
        assert response == "I am sad"
```

You can also mock both `ClassifySentiment` and `GetSadResponse`.

```python test_pipeline.py
@baml_test
async def test_pipeline():
    message = "I am ecstatic"
    # Indicate we are mocking the ClassifySentiment function
    with b.ClassifySentiment.mock() as classify_sentiment_mock, b.GetSadResponse.mock() as get_sad_response_mock, b.GetHappyResponse.mock() as get_happy_response_mock:
        # Set the return value of the mock
        classify_sentiment_mock.return_value = Sentiment.NEGATIVE
        get_sad_response_mock.return_value = "I am sad"

        response = await pipeline(message)

        classify_sentiment_mock.assert_called()
        get_sad_response_mock.assert_called()
        get_happy_response_mock.assert_not_called()

        assert response == "I am sad"
```
