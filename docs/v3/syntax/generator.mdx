title: generator

The `generator` configuration needs to be added anywhere in .baml files to generate the `baml_client` in Python or Typescript.

Here is how you can add a generator block:

```rust
generator {
  language python
    // poetry is the default if this doesn't exist
  pkg_manager pip
}
```
