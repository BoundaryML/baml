title: Deserialization
---

Baml uses a custom `Deserializer` to parse a string into the desired type.

Instead of doing the following:

```python

import json

openai_response_text = await openai.completions.create(
  ...
)
response = SomePydanticModel(**json.loads(openai_response_text))

```

Instead of directly passing the results of the LLM to pydantic or zod, we do a first pass to help massage the data. We'll outline some examples where this is useful.

## Error handling

All parsing errors are handled by the `Deserializer` and will raise a `DeserializationError`.

```python

from baml_client import baml as b
from baml_client import DeserializationError

try:
  response = await b.SomeAIFunction(query="I want to buy a car")
except DeserializationError as e:
  # The parser was not able read the response as the expected type
  print(e)

```
