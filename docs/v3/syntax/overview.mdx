This section outlines the syntax of BAML as well as the LLM-specific functionality it enables.

## Why use BAML vs other libraries or frameworks?

1. **Use an integrated VSCode playground** - The playground is co-located with your prompt configurations. No need to context switch out of VSCode for simple tests.
1. **Comments in prompts** - You heard that right... we added support for [comments inside the actual prompt string](/v2/mdx/baml-by-example#comments).
1. **Strong type safety** - Query your data with into fully typed pandas dataframes of your input and output objects, rather than raw strings or JSON. (Coming soon)
1. **Powerful deserialization** - BAML parses your inputs and outputs for you, and provides guardrails to ensure your inputs and outputs are valid. _Even when the JSON is valid, the desired output type may not be what you wanted_. The BAML deserializer can smartly detect when an LLM may have output a string rather than a number, and still parse things correctly. For enums it even keeps track of hallucinated values.
1. **Code organization** - Organize your code in statically analyzed BAML files, without having to use plaintext or YAML
1. **Out-of-the-box request tracing and data analytics**
1. **Test Suites** - Run and visualize test results for all your BAML functions over time using the playground or using our dashboard-enabled pytest plugin.
1. **Flexibility and cross-compatibility** - Running BAML prompts are as easy as copying the BAML files over and pressing "run"
1. **Prompt linting** - Get warnings when your prompt isn't following best practices. We are planning on adding custom guidelines.

## Why did you make this?

We wanted to build a toolchain from the ground up that would allow us to build and deploy LLMs in a way that is easy to understand, test, and debug. Also, this was a great excuse to write a rust compiler.

Our vision is to support any AI model, not just LLMs, so when you fine-tune a model to complete a task an LLM used to do, you can swap it over in one line of code. If you do end up using the Dashboard product, we want you to be able to load it in a pandas dataframe, in a fully typed manner (because BAML stores all type info for you!), to train whatever you want.
