title: The BAML Project structure
---

A BAML project has the following structure:


```bash
.
├── baml_client/
└── baml_src/
    ├── __tests__/
    │   ├── YourAIFunction/
    │   │   ├── test_name_monkey.json
    │   │   └── test_name_cricket.json
    │   └── YourAIFunction2/
    │       └── test_name_jellyfish.json
    ├── main.baml
    └── foo.baml
```

1. **baml_src** is the directory where you write your BAML files with the AI function declarations, prompts, retry policies, etc. It also contains a [generator](/v3/syntax/generator) block that indicates where to generate code to and what language to compile to.
2. **baml_client** is the directory where the generated python or TS client code lives. This is the code that you import into your python or TS program like this:

```python
from baml_client import baml as b

...
await b.YourAIFunction()
```

3. **baml_src/__tests__/** are where your unit tests live. The .json files store the test inputs that can be loaded, deleted, created, and ran using the BAML VSCode extension. You can also write programmatic python/TS tests anywhere you like. See [here](/v3/syntax/function-testing) for more information.


<Warning>**You should never edit any files inside baml_client directory** as the whole directory gets generated automatically everytime you save a `.baml` file if you're using the BAML VSCode extension. </Warning>

<Tip>If you ever run into any issues with the generated code (like merge conflicts), you can always delete the `baml_client` directory and it will get regenerated automatically once you fix any other conflicts in your `.baml` files.</Tip>

### imports
BAML has no import logic like other languages. Every entity declared in a `.baml` file is available to all other `.baml` files under the same `baml_src` directory. You **can** can multiple baml_src directories, but we don't currently recommend it.
