title: "function"
---

A function is the contract between the application and the AI model. It defines the input and output.

We specifically seprate out functions and their defintions because in machine learnings,
its often common to swap out model parameters, what model architecture is used, or even
if you're using an LLM vs a Heuristic vs a combination of both to get the answer.

The actual implementation (prompt or other settings) of the function is described in an [impl](/v3/syntax/impl).

With baml, you can modify the implementation of a function and keep the application logic that uses the
function unchanged.

## Properties

| Property       | Type                        | Description                                                            | Required                                                                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input`        | Any [type](/v3/syntax/type) | The input type of the function                                         | YES                                                                           |
| `output`       | Any [type](/v3/syntax/type) | The output type of the function                                        | YES                                                                           |
| `default_impl` | string                      | The name of the impl to use when the application logic doesn't specify | Only if you define multiple impls for a function. See [impl](/v3/syntax/impl) |

## Examples

### Single Argument

<CodeGroup>
```rust Baml
function GetSentiment {
    // In the case of a single argument, you can specify the
    // type directly.
    input   string
    output  string
}
```

```python Using Generated Python Code
from baml_client import baml as b

# GetSentiment is a function defined in the baml file
# response is a string
response = await b.GetSentiment("I love this movie")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Named-arguments (multiple arguments)

<CodeGroup>

```rust Baml
enum Color {
    Red
    Green
    Blue
}

function GetSentiment {
    // You can have as many arguments (1+) as you want, but
    // they must be named if specified between parentheses.
    input   (query: string, millis: int)
    output  Color[]
}
```

```python Using Generated Python Code
from baml_client import baml as b

# Since GetSentiment has multiple arguments, each
# argument is passed in as a named argument.
# response is List[Color]
response = await b.GetSentiment(
    query="I love this movie", millis=1000)

```
