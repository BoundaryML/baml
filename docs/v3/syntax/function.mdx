title: "function"
---

A **function** is the contract between the application and the AI model. It defines the desired **input** and **output**.

<img src="/images/v3/BAML_contract.png" />

We specifically separate out functions and their defintions because in machine learning,
its often common to swap out model parameters, what model architecture is used, or even
if you're using an LLM vs a Heuristic vs a combination of both to get the answer.

The actual implementation (prompt or other settings) of the function is described in an [impl](/v3/syntax/impl).

With baml, you can modify the implementation of a function and keep the application logic that uses the
function unchanged.


## Properties

| Property       | Type                        | Description                                                            | Required                                                                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input`        | Any [type](/v3/syntax/type) or with named args:<br/>`(<name>: <type>, ...)` | The input type of the function                                         | YES                                                                           |
| `output`       | Any [type](/v3/syntax/type) | The output type of the function                                        | YES                                                                           |
| `default_impl` | string                      | The name of the impl to use when the application logic doesn't specify | Only if you define multiple impls for a function. See [impl](/v3/syntax/impl) |

## Examples - How to call functions
See the "generated python code" tab to see how to call the function in python.
### Single Argument with Primitive Type

```rust BAMl
function GetSentiment {
    // In the case of a single argument, you can specify the
    // type directly.
    input   string[]
    output  string
}
```

<CodeGroup>

```python Python Usage
from baml_client import baml as b

# GetSentiment is a function defined in the baml file
# response is a string
response = await b.GetSentiment(["I love this movie", "it is amazing"])
```

```typescript TypeScript Usage
import b from "@/baml_client";

const response = await b.GetSentiment(["I love this movie", "it is amazing"]);
```

</CodeGroup>


### Class argument

```rust BAML
class CustomerInfo {
    name: string
    age: int
    address: string
}

function SummarizeCustomerDetails {
    // In the case of a single argument, you can specify the
    // type directly.
    input   CustomerInfo
    output  string
}
```

<CodeGroup>

```python Python Usage
from baml_client import baml as b
# Import the CustomerInfo pydantic model we generated
from baml_client.types import CustomerInfo

response = await b.SummarizeCustomerDetails(
    CustomerInfo(name="John", age=30, address="123 Main St"))
```

```typescript TypeScript Usage
import b from "@/baml_client";

const response = await b.SummarizeCustomerDetails({
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    address: "123 Main St",
});
```

</CodeGroup>


### Named-arguments (multiple arguments)

```rust BAML
enum Color {
    Red
    Green
    Blue
}

function GetSentiment {
    // You can have as many arguments (1+) as you want, but
    // they must be named if specified between parentheses.
    input   (query: string, millis: int)
    output  Color[]
}
```

<CodeGroup>

```python Python Usage
from baml_client import baml as b

# Since GetSentiment has multiple arguments, each
# argument is passed in as a named argument.
# response is List[Color]
response = await b.GetSentiment(query="I love this movie", millis=1000)
```

```typescript TypeScript Usage
import b from "@/baml_client";

const response = await b.GetSentiment({
    query: "I love this movie",
    millis: 1000,
});
```
