title: "function"
---

A function is a definition of an input and output.

The implementation of the function is described in a [variant](variant-llm).

We specifically seprate out functions and their defintions because in machine learnings,
its often common to swap out model parameters, what model architecture is used, or even
if you're using an LLM vs a Heuristic vs a combination of both to get the answer.

With baml, you can swap out the function definition and keep the rest of the code that uses the
function the same.

<CodeGroup>
```llvm Baml
function GetSentiment {
    input   string
    output  string
}
```

```python Python Equivalent
from typing import Callable

GetSentiment = Callable[[str], str]
```

```typescript Typescript Equivalent
type GetSentiment = (str: string) => string;
```
