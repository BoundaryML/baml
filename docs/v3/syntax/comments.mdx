<Warning>
    You are currently viewing the old BAML documentation. This syntax is still supported, but will eventually be deprecated in newer versions of BAML.
</Warning>


## Single line / trailing comments

Denoted by `//`.

```rust
// hello there!
foo // this is a trailing comment
```

## Docstrings

To add a docstring to any block, use `///`.

```rust
/// This is a docstring for a class
class {
    /// This is a docstring for a property
    property1 string
}
```

## Multiline comments

Multiline comments are denoted via `{//` and `//}`.

```rust
{// this is a multiline comment
    foo
    bar
//}
```

Multiline comments also work inside of [block strings](/v3/syntax/strings#block-strings).

```rust
#"
    My string {// this is a comment! //} is cool!
"#
```
