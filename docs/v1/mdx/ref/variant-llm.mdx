title: "@variant[llm]"
---

A `@variant[llm]` is an implementation of a `@function` which uses an LLM. Gloo automatically provides:

1. **A type-safe API for your LLM** -- we handle hallucinations and parsing for you
2. **Database safety** -- `@stringify` allows migrate llm specific text to your well-defined `@output` type
3. **Compile time checks for prompts**
4. **Organization** -- everything (configs, variables, renames) related to each prompt are defined and visible in one place
5. **Observability** -- everything is tracked and visible on the dashboard

## Type Safety (error handling)

Gloo uses our `Forgiving Parser` to help extract data as much as possible.

Instead of directly passing the results of the LLM to pydantic or zod, we do a first
pass to help massage the data. We'll outline some examples where this is useful.

| LLM Output                 | Desired Type | Gloo Output            | How                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| positive                   | Sentiment    | `Sentiment.Positive`   | We handle case insensitivity                                                               |
| \{ "feeling": "positive"\} | Sentiment    | `Sentiment.Positive`   | When looking for a singular value, we can parse dictionaries of 1 keys as singular objects |
| positive                   | Sentiment[]  | `[Sentiment.Positive]` | None array types are automatically converted                                               |

This applies not just to `@enum` types, but all types ([See types](/mdx/ref/type)).

## Injecting inputs into the prompt

### @input

`@input` allows you to pass in the function's input text (or object) to the LLM prompt

#### How @input behaves if it's a string or enum

Using \{@input\} in your prompt is the equivalent of `str(arg)`.

#### How @input behaves if it's a custom type

Sometimes you might want to have your function take in an object. In this case, adding `{@input}` to your prompt is still used to access `str(your-object)`, but you can inject individual properties like this:

`@input.property1` to inject `str(arg.property1)`

This can be done with class `@method` as well ([See Methods](/mdx/ref/method#class)), with `@input.methodName`.

### Formatting the @output

The @output is the function's return type.

Using `{@output.json}` in the prompt is used to print out the JSON schema of the output type in your prompt.
Gloo automatically generates a JSON schema for you, but you can customize it with `@stringify`.

#### @stringify - Add a custom output schema description

In LLMs it is often useful to rename or provide descriptions about the task you are attempting to do. For example, you may want to rename a property from `duration` to `duration_in_minutes` so the LLM can understand what value it should output better.

`@stringify` allows you to change the default JSON schema of any property or sub-property of your output type.

You can use it to change the `@output.json` from being serialized as:

```
{
  "duration": 10
}
```

to

```json
{
  "duration_in_minutes": 10
}
```

without having to change your code or the actual type definition.

`{@output.json}` will automatically parse all your @stringify'd properties and replace the default JSON schema with your own custom aliases and descriptions of each field.

#### @stringify -- Enums

You can use `@EnumName.values` to automatically inject all the `value: description` pairs of your enums.
For values without a description, only `value` will be injected.

To modify the description of each value, see the examples below.

<CodeGroup>
```gloo Ex 1: describe
@enum Sentiment {
    Positive
    Negative
    Neutral
}
@variant[llm] v1 for GetSentiment {
    ..
    @stringify Sentiment {
    Positive
    @describe{When the sentence is about good things that happened recently}

        Negative
        @describe{When the sentence is about bad things that happened recently}

        Neutral
        @describe{
            Sentences that are neutral or happend too long ago to be relevant
        }
    }

}

````

```gloo Ex 1: Prompt
Given a sentence, return the sentiment of the sentence.

{@input}

Sentiments:
Positive: When the sentence is about good things that happened recently
Negative: When the sentence is about bad things that happened recently
Neutral: Sentences that are neutral or happend too long ago to be relevant

Sentiment:
````

```gloo Ex 2: Rename
# In this example, we rename what we call each `Sentiment` value, but still
# guarantee the `Sentiment` enum as an output (thanks to Gloo's parser).
@variant[llm] v2 for GetSentiment {
    ...
    @stringify Sentiment {
        Positive @rename{Good}
        @describe{When the sentence is about good things that happened recently}

        Negative @rename{Bad}
        @describe{When the sentence is about bad things that happened recently}

        Neutral
        @describe{Sentences that are neutral or happend too long ago to be relevant}
    }
}
```

```gloo Ex 2: Prompt
Given a sentence, return the sentiment of the sentence.

{@input}

Sentiments:
Good: When the sentence is about good things that happened recently
Bad: When the sentence is about bad things that happened recently
Neutral: Sentences that are neutral or happend too long ago to be relevant

Sentiment:
```

```gloo Ex 3: Skip
# You can also skip any values you don't want to parse.
@variant[llm] v2 for GetSentiment {
    ...
    @stringify Sentiment {
        Positive @rename{Good}
        @describe{When the sentence is about good things that happened recently}

        Negative @rename{Bad}
        @describe{When the sentence is about bad things that happened recently}

        Neutral @rename{Neither} @skip
        @describe{
            Sentences that are neutral or happend too long ago to be relevant
        }
    }
}
```

```gloo Ex 3: Prompt
Given a sentence, return the sentiment of the sentence.

{@input}

Sentiments:
Good: When the sentence is about good things that happened recently
Bad: When the sentence is about bad things that happened recently

Sentiment:
```

#### @stringify -- Class

Just like enums, you have access to `@describe` and `@rename` for class properties. `@skip` is not avaiable.

There is a special method you can use to represent the class as a string: `@ClassName.json`.

In all of the examples below, the output of the function will still be the type: `Person[]`.

```gloo
@class Person {
    name string
    age int
}

@function GetPerson {
    @input string
    @output Person[]
}
```

<CodeGroup>

```gloo Ex 1: Basic
@variant[llm] v1 for GetPerson {
    @prompt {
        Given the sentence, return all the details about all people detected.

        {@input}

        Output JSON:
        {@output.json}

        JSON:
    }
}
```

```gloo Ex 1: Prompt
Given the sentence, return all the details about all people detected.

{@input}

Output JSON:
{ "name": string, "age": int }[]

JSON:
```

```gloo Ex 2: Describe
# In this example, we'll add a description to get more details.
@variant[llm] v2 for GetPerson {
    @stringify Person {
        age @describe{in months}
    }

    @prompt {
        Given the sentence, return all the details about all people detected.

        {@input}

        Output JSON:
        {@output.json}

        JSON:
    }
}
```

```gloo Ex 2: Prompt
Given the sentence, return all the details about all people detected.

{@input}

Output JSON:
{ "name": string, "age": age in months }[]

JSON:
```

```gloo Ex 3: Rename
# In this example, we'll instead rename the property to `age_in_months`.
@variant[llm] v3 for GetPerson {
    @stringify Person {
        age @rename{age_in_months}
    }

    @prompt {
        Given the sentence, return all the details about all people detected.

        {@input}

        Output JSON:
        {@output.json}

        JSON:
    }
}
```

```gloo Ex 3: Prompt
Given the sentence, return all the details about all people detected.

{@input}

Output JSON:
{ "name": string, "age_in_months": int }[]

JSON:
```
