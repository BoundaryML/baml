To define your own custom enum in Gloo:

<CodeGroup>
```gloo Gloo
@enum MyEnum {
  Value1
  Value2
  Value3
}
```

```python Python Equivalent
from enum import StrEnum

class MyEnum(StrEnum):
  Value1 = "Value1"
  Value2 = "Value2"
  Value3 = "Value3"
```

```Typescript Typescript Equivalent
enum MyEnum {
  Value1 = "Value1",
  Value2 = "Value2",
  Value3 = "Value3",
}
```
</CodeGroup>

You may have as many values as you'd like. Values may not be duplicated or empty. Values may not contain spaces or special characters and must not start with a number.
