(BAML) Basically A Made-up Language

BAML is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for building AI applications and interacting with AI models.

BAML helps you define your ML model inputs and outputs, and generates Python / Typescript (soon) code to call your models. Rather than interacting with LLMs using raw strings, BAML adds a thin but powerful layer between your LLM and your code that translates all strings to your strongly-typed model inputs and outputs. 


Because BAML can track every type sent and received, that means you can query it more powerful ways -- so you can train other custom models using LLM-generated data. This language has also allowed us to build powerful features like an **integrated VSCode BAML playground**.

If youâ€™re building a chatbot, or any LLM application, BAML is a good way to decompose your task into specific more measurable tasks (classification, entity extraction, etc).

BAML is inspired by **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**, a DSL for databases. BAML is designed to be a **DSL for AI model tasks**.



## BAML Components
1. **VSCode Extension** - A VSCode extension that provides a playground, syntax highlighting and static analysis for BAML files.
2. **BAML CLI** - A CLI that provides code generation for BAML files to python (and soon typescript)
3. **BAML Python Library** - Utilities that enables generated BAML functions to trace inputs and outputs. We build on top of the **OpenTelemetry** standard.
4. **Gloo Dashboard** - A dashboard that allows you to view and query your BAML executions, run test suites, label data, and soon train new models.



## LLM Classification Task example
Below is what you need to get a working **classification task** using LLMs using BAML. 

**BAML configuration**
<img src="/images/baml/full-prompt-baml.png" />

Calling the generated function:
```python
from baml_client import baml

async def classify():
  response = await baml.ClassifyTool.get_impl("v1").run(
    ClassifyRequest(
      query="What is TDD?",
      context="The user is a software engineer"
    )
  )
```

### Gloo Dashboard
The dashboard helps you track requests, label data, and run test suites.

### VSCode Playground
The VSCode playground allows you to test prompts instantly and see the generated prompt.

## Why use BAML vs other libraries or frameworks?
1. **Use an integrated VSCode playground** - The playground is co-located with your prompt configurations. No need to context switch out of VSCode for simple tests.
1. **Comments in prompts** - You heard that right... we added support for [comments inside the actual prompt string](/v2/mdx/baml-by-example#comments).
1. **Strong type safety** - Query your data with into fully typed pandas dataframes of your input and output objects, rather than raw strings or JSON. (Coming soon)
1. **Smarter deserialization** - BAML parses your inputs and outputs for you, and provides guardrails to ensure your inputs and outputs are valid. _Even when the JSON is valid, the desired output type may not be what you wanted_. The BAML deserializer can smartly detect when an LLM may have output a string rather than a number, and still parse things correctly. For enums it even keeps track of hallucinated values.
1. **Code organization** - Organize your code in statically analyzed BAML files, without having to use plaintext or YAML
1. **Out-of-the-box request tracing and data analytics**
1. **Test Suites** - Run and visualize test results for all your BAML functions over time using the playground or using our dashboard-enabled pytest plugin.
1. **Flexibility and cross-compatibility** - Running BAML prompts are as easy as copying the BAML files over and pressing "run"
1. **Prompt linting** - Get warnings when your prompt isn't following best practices. We are planning on adding custom guidelines.
